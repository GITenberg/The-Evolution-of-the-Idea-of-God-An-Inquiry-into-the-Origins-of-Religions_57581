    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>WO main schools of
      religious thinking exist in our midst at the present day: the school of
      humanists and the school of animists. This work is to some extent an
      attempt to reconcile them. It contains, I believe, the first extended
      effort that has yet been made to trace the genesis of the belief in a God
      from its earliest origin in the mind of primitive man up to its fullest
      development in advanced and etherealised Christian theology. My method is
      therefore constructive, not destructive. Instead of setting out to argue
      away or demolish a deep-seated and ancestral element in our complex
      nature, this book merely posits for itself the psychological question,
      &ldquo;By what successive steps did men come to frame for themselves the
      conception of a deity?&rdquo;&mdash;or, if the reader so prefers it,
      &ldquo;How did we arrive at our knowledge of God?&rdquo; It seeks
      provisionally to answer these profound and important questions by
      reference to the earliest beliefs of savages, past or present, and to the
      testimony of historical documents and ancient monuments. It does not
      concern itself at all with the validity or invalidity of the ideas in
      themselves; it does but endeavour to show how inevitable they were, and
      how man&rsquo;s relation with the external universe was certain <i>a
      priori</i> to beget them as of necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In so vast a synthesis, it would be absurd to pretend at the present day
      that one approached one&rsquo;s subject entirely <i>de novo</i>. Every
      enquirer must needs depend much upon the various researches of his
      predecessors in various parts of his field of enquiry. The problem before
      us divides itself into three main portions: <i>first</i>, how did men come
      to believe in many gods&mdash;the origin of polytheism; <i>second</i>,
      how, by elimination of most of these gods, did certain races of men come
      to believe in one single supreme and omnipotent God&mdash;the origin of
      monotheism; <i>third</i> how, having arrived at that concept, did the most
      advanced races and civilisations come to conceive of that God as Triune,
      and to identify one of his Persons with a particular divine and human
      incarnation&mdash;the origin of Christianity. In considering each of these
      three main problems I have been greatly guided and assisted by three
      previous enquirers or sets of enquirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the <i>origin of polytheism</i>, I have adopted in the main Mr.
      Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s remarkable ghost theory, though with certain
      important modifications and additions. In this part of my work I have also
      been largely aided by materials derived from Mr. Duff Macdonald, the able
      author of <i>Africana</i>, from Mr. Turner, the well-known Samoan
      missionary, and from several other writers, supplemented as they are by my
      own researches among the works of explorers and ethnologists in general.
      On the whole, I have here accepted the theory which traces the origin of
      the belief in gods to primeval ancestor-worship, or rather corpse-worship,
      as against the rival theory which traces its origin to a supposed
      primitive animism.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the <i>rise of monotheism</i>, I have been influenced in no small
      degree by Kuenen and the Teutonic school of Old Testament criticism, whose
      ideas have been supplemented by later concepts derived from Professor
      Robertson Smith&rsquo;s admirable work, <i>The Religion of the Semites</i>.
      But here, on the whole, the central explanation I have to offer is, I
      venture to think, new and original: the theory, good or bad, of the
      circumstances which led to the elevation of the ethnical Hebrew God,
      Jahweh, above all his rivals, and his final recognition as the only true
      and living god, is my own and no one else&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the <i>origin of Christianity</i>, and its relations to the
      preceding cults of corn and wine gods, I have been guided to a great
      extent by Mr. J. G. Frazer and Mannhardt, though I do not suppose that
      either the living or the dead anthropologist would wholly acquiesce in the
      use I have made of their splendid materials. Mr. Frazer, the author of
      that learned work, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, has profoundly influenced the
      opinions of all serious workers at anthropology and the science of
      religion, and I cannot too often acknowledge the deep obligations under
      which I lie to his profound and able treatises. At the same time, I have
      so transformed the material derived from him and from Dr. Robertson Smith
      as to have made it in many ways practically my own; and I have
      supplemented it by several new examples and ideas, suggested in the course
      of my own tolerably wide reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the book as a whole, I also owe a considerable debt to Dr. E.
      B. Tylor, from whom I have borrowed much valuable matter; to Mr. Sidney
      Hartland&rsquo;s <i>Legend of Perseus</i>; to Mr. Lawrence Gomme, who has
      come nearer at times than anyone else to the special views and theories
      here promulgated; and to Mr. William Simpson of the <i>Illustrated London
      News</i>, an unobtrusive scholar whose excellent monographs on <i>The
      Worship of Death</i> and kindred subjects have never yet received the
      attention They deserve, at the hands of unprejudiced students of religion.
      My other obligations, to Dr. Mommsen, to my friends Mr. Edward Clodd,
      Professor John Rhys, and Professor York Powell, as well as to numerous
      travellers, missionaries, historians, and classicists, are too frequent to
      specify.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the subject broadly, I would presume to say once more that my
      general conclusions may be regarded as representing to some extent a
      reconciliation between the conflicting schools of humanists and animists,
      headed respectively by Mr. Spencer and Mr. Frazer, though with a leaning
      rather to the former than the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time it would be a great mistake to look upon my book as in
      any sense a mere eirenicon or compromise. On the contrary, it is in every
      part a new and personal work, containing, whatever its value, a fresh and
      original synthesis of the subject. I would venture to point out as
      especially novel the two following points: the complete demarcation of
      religion from mythology, as practice from mere explanatory gloss or
      guesswork; and the important share assigned in the genesis of most
      existing religious systems to the deliberate manufacture of gods by
      killing. This doctrine of the manufactured god, to which nearly half my
      book is devoted, seems to me to be a notion of cardinal value. Among other
      new ideas of secondary rank, I would be bold enough to enumerate the
      following: the establishment of three successive stages in the conception
      of the Life of the Dead, which might be summed up as Corpse-worship,
      Ghost-worship, and Shade-worship, and which answer to the three stages of
      preservation or mummification, burial, and cremation; the recognition of
      the high place to be assigned to the safe-keeping of the oracular head in
      the growth of idol-worship; the importance attached to the sacred stone,
      the sacred stake, and the sacred tree, and the provisional proof of their
      close connection with the graves of the dead; the entirely new conception
      of the development of monotheism among the Jews from the exclusive cult of
      the jealous god; the hypothesis of the origin of cultivation from
      tumulus-offerings, and its connection with the growth of gods of
      cultivation; the wide expansion given to the ancient notion of the
      divine-human victim; the recognition of the world-wide prevalence of the
      five-day festival of the corn or wine god, and of the close similarity
      which marks its rites throughout all the continents, including America;
      the suggested evolution of the god-eating sacraments of lower religions
      from the cannibal practice of honorifically eating one&rsquo;s dead
      relations; * and the evidence of the wide survival of primitive
      corpse-worship down to our own times in civilised Europe. I could largely
      increase this rapid list of what I believe to be the new contributions
      here made to the philosophy of religious evolution; but I purposely
      refrain. I think it will be allowed that if even a few of these ideas turn
      out on examination to be both new and true, my book will have succeeded in
      justifying its existence.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * While this work was passing through the press a similar
     theory has been propounded by Mr. Flinders Petrie in an
     article on &ldquo;Eaten with Honour,&rdquo; in which he reviews briefly
     the evidence for the custom in Egypt and elsewhere.
</pre>
    <p>
      I put forth this work with the utmost diffidence. The harvest is vast and
      the labourers are few. I have been engaged upon collecting and comparing
      materials for more than twenty years. I have been engaged in writing my
      book for more than ten. As I explain in the last chapter, the present
      first sketch of the conclusions at which I have at last arrived is little
      more than provisional. I desire in my present essay merely to lay down the
      lines of the general theory which after so many years of study I incline
      to accept. If my attempt succeeds in attracting public attention, I hope
      to follow it up by several other volumes in which the main opinions or
      suggestions here set forth may be reinforced and expanded by copious
      collections of evidence and illustrations. If it fails to arouse public
      attention, however, I must perforce be satisfied with this very inadequate
      preliminary statement. I should also like to add here, what I point out at
      greater length in the body of the work, that I do not hold dogmatically to
      all or to a single one of the ideas I have now expressed. They are merely
      conceptions forced upon my mind by the present state of the evidence; and
      I recognise the fact that in so vast and varied a province, where almost
      encyclopaedic knowledge would be necessary in order to enable one to reach
      a decided conclusion, every single one or all together of these
      conceptions are liable to be upset by further research. I merely say,
      &ldquo;This is how the matter figures itself to me at present, on the
      strength of the facts now and here known to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few chapters of the book were separately published in various reviews at
      the time they were first written. They were composed, however, from the
      outset, as parts of this book, which does not therefore consist of
      disconnected essays thrown into line in an artificial unity. Each occupies
      the precise place in the argument for which it was first intended. The
      chapters in question are those on &ldquo;Religion and Mythology,&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;The Life of the Dead,&rdquo; contributed under the titles of
      &ldquo;Practical Religion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Immortality and Resurrection&rdquo;
      to the <i>Fortnightly Re-view</i>; that on &ldquo;Sacred Stones,&rdquo;
      contributed under the same name to the same periodical; and that on
      &ldquo;The Gods of Egypt,&rdquo; which originally appeared in the <i>Universal
      Review</i>. I have to thank the proprietors and editors of those magazines
      for permission to print them in their proper place here. They have all
      been altered and brought up as far as I could bring them to the existing
      state of our knowledge with regard to the subjects of which they treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dealing with so large a variety of materials, drawn from all times and
      places, races and languages, it would be well-nigh impossible to avoid
      errors. Such as my own care could discover I have of course corrected: for
      the rest, I must ask on this ground the indulgence of those who may happen
      to note them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have endeavoured to write without favour or prejudice, animated by a
      single desire to discover the truth. Whether I have succeeded in that
      attempt or not, I trust my book may be received in the same spirit in
      which it has been written,&mdash;a spirit of earnest anxiety to learn all
      that can be learnt by enquiry and investigation of man&rsquo;s connection
      with his God, in the past and the present. In this hope I commit it to the
      kindly consideration of that small section of the reading public which
      takes a living interest in religious questions.

      CHAPTER I.&mdash;CHRISTIANITY AS A RELIGIOUS STANDARD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> propose in this
      work to trace out in rough outline the evolution of the idea of God from
      its earliest and crudest beginnings in the savage mind of primitive man to
      that highly evolved and abstract form which it finally assumes in
      contemporary philosophical and theological thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eyes of the modern evolutionary enquirer the interest of the origin
      and history of this widespread idea is mainly psychological. We have
      before us a vast and pervasive group of human opinions, true or false,
      which have exercised and still exercise an immense influence upon the
      development of mankind and of civilisation: the question arises, Why did
      human beings ever come to hold these opinions at all, and how did they
      arrive at them? What was there in the conditions of early man which led
      him to frame to himself such abstract notions of one or more great
      supernatural agents, of whose objective existence he had certainly in
      nature no clear or obvious evidence? Regarding the problem in this light,
      as essentially a problem of the processes of the human mind, I set aside
      from the outset, as foreign to my purpose, any kind of enquiry into the
      objective validity of any one among the religious beliefs thus set <span
      class="pagenum">002</span><a name="link002" id="link002"></a>before us as
      subject-matter. The question whether there may be a God or gods, and, if
      so, what may be his or their substance and attributes, do not here concern
      us. All we have to do in our present capacity is to ask ourselves
      strictly, What first suggested to the mind of man the notion of deity in
      the abstract at all? And how, from the early multiplicity of deities which
      we find to have prevailed in all primitive times among all human races,
      did the conception of a single great and unlimited deity first take its
      rise? In other words, why did men ever believe there were gods at all, and
      why from many gods did they arrive at one? Why from polytheism have the
      most advanced nations proceeded to monotheism?
    </p>
    <p>
      To put the question in this form is to leave entirely out of consideration
      the objective reality or otherwise of the idea itself. To analyse the
      origin of a concept is not to attack the validity of the belief it
      encloses. The idea of gravitation, for example, arose by slow degrees in
      human minds, and reached at last its final expression in Newton&rsquo;s
      law. But to trace the steps by which that idea was gradually reached is
      not in any way to disprove or to discredit it. The Christian believer may
      similarly hold that men arrived by natural stages at the knowledge of the
      one true God; he is not bound to reject the final conception as false
      merely because of the steps by which it was slowly evolved. A creative
      God, it is true, might prefer to make a sudden revelation of himself to
      some chosen body of men; but an evolutionary God, we may well believe,
      might prefer in his inscrutable wisdom to reveal his own existence and
      qualities to his creatures by means of the same slow and tentative
      intellectual gropings as those by which he revealed to them the physical
      truths of nature. I wish my enquiry, therefore, to be regarded, not as
      destructive, but as reconstructive. It only attempts to recover and follow
      out the various planes in the evolution of the idea of God, rather than to
      cast doubt upon the truth of the evolved concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      In<span class="pagenum">003</span><a name="link003" id="link003"></a>
      investigating any abstruse and difficult subject, it is often best to
      proceed from the known to the unknown, even although the unknown itself
      may happen to come first in the order of nature and of logical
      development. For this reason, it may be advisable to begin here with a
      brief preliminary examination of Christianity, which is not only the most
      familiar of all religions to us Christian nations, but also the best known
      in its origins: and then to show how far we may safely use it as a
      Standard of Reference in explaining the less obvious and certain features
      of earlier or collateral cults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christianity, then, viewed as a religious standard, has this clear and
      undeniable advantage over almost every other known form of faith&mdash;that
      it quite frankly and confessedly sets out in its development with the
      worship of a particular Deified Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point in its history cannot, I think, be overrated in importance,
      because in that single indubitable central fact it gives us the key to
      much that is cardinal in all other religions; every one of which, as I
      hope hereafter to show, equally springs, directly or indirectly, from the
      worship of a single Deified Man, or of many Deified Men, more or less
      etherealised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever else may be said about the origin of Christianity, it is at least
      fairly agreed on either side, both by friends and foes, that this great
      religion took its rise around the personality of a certain particular
      Galilean teacher, by name Jesus, concerning whom, if we know anything at
      all with any approach to certainty, we know at least that he was a man of
      the people, hung on a cross in Jerusalem under the procuratorship of Caius
      Pontius Pilatus. That kernel of fact&mdash;a man, and his death&mdash;Jesus
      Christ and him crucified&mdash;is the one almost undoubted historical
      nucleus round which all the rest of a vast European and Asiatic system of
      thought and belief has slowly crystallised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us figure clearly to ourselves the full import of these truths. <span
      class="pagenum">004</span><a name="link004" id="link004"></a>A Deified Man
      is the central figure in the faith of Christendom.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the very beginning, however, a legend, true or false (but whose truth
      or falsity has no relation whatever to our present subject), gathered
      about the personality of this particular Galilean peasant reformer.
      Reverenced at first by a small body of disciples of his own race and
      caste, he grew gradually in their minds into a divine personage, of whom
      strange stories were told, and a strange history believed by a group of
      ever-increasing adherents in all parts of the Græco-Roman Mediterranean
      civilisation. The earliest of these stories, in all probability&mdash;certainly
      the one to which most importance was attached by the pioneers of the faith&mdash;clustered
      about his death and its immediate sequence. Jesus, we are told, was
      crucified, dead, and buried. But at the end of three days, if we may
      credit the early documents of our Christian faith, his body was no longer
      to be found in the sepulchre where it had been laid by friendly hands: and
      the report spread abroad that he had risen again from the dead, and lived
      once more a somewhat phantasmal life among the living in his province.
      Supernatural messengers announced his resurrection to the women who had
      loved him: he was seen in the flesh from time to time for very short
      periods by one or other among the faithful who still revered his memory.
      At last, after many such appearances, more or less fully described in the
      crude existing narratives, he was suddenly carried up to the sky before
      the eyes of his followers, where, as one of the versions authoritatively
      remarks, he was &ldquo;received into heaven, and sat on the right hand of
      God&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, of Jahweh, the ethnical deity of the
      Hebrew people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such in its kernel was the original Christian doctrine as handed down to
      us amid a mist of miracle, in four or five documents of doubtful age and
      uncertain authenticity. Even this central idea does not fully appear in
      the Pauline epistles, believed to be the oldest in date of all our
      Christian <span class="pagenum">005</span><a name="link005" id="link005"></a>writings:
      it first takes full shape in the somewhat later Gospels and Acts of the
      Apostles. In the simplest and perhaps the earliest of these definite
      accounts we are merely told the story of the death and resurrection, the
      latter fact being vouched for on the dubious testimony of &ldquo;a young
      man clothed in a long white garment,&rdquo; supplemented (apparently at a
      later period) by subsequent &ldquo;appearances&rdquo; to various
      believers. With the controversies which have raged about these different
      stories, however, the broad anthropological enquiry into the evolution of
      God has no concern. It is enough for us here to admit, what the evidence
      probably warrants us in concluding, that a real historical man of the name
      of Jesus did once exist in Lower Syria, and that his disciples at a period
      very shortly after his execution believed him to have actually risen from
      the dead, and in due time to have ascended into heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a very early date, too, it was further asserted that Jesus was in some
      unnatural or supernatural sense &ldquo;the son of God&rdquo;&mdash;that is
      to say, once more, the son of Jahweh, the local and national deity of the
      Jewish people. In other words, his worship was affiliated upon the earlier
      historical worship of the people in whose midst he lived, and from whom
      his first disciples were exclusively gathered. It was not, as we shall
      more fully see hereafter, a revolutionary or purely destructive system. It
      based itself upon the common conceptions of the Semitic community. The
      handful of Jews and Galileans who accepted Jesus as a divine figure did
      not think it necessary, in adopting him as a god, to get rid of their own
      preconceived religious opinions. They believed rather in his prior
      existence, as a part of Jahweh, and in his incarnation in a human body for
      the purpose of redemption. And when his cult spread around into
      neighboring countries (chiefly, it would seem, through the instrumentality
      of one Paul of Tarsus, who had never seen him, or had beheld him only in
      what is vaguely called &ldquo;a vision&rdquo;) the cult <span
      class="pagenum">006</span><a name="link006" id="link006"></a>of Jahweh
      went hand in hand with it, so that a sort of modified mystic monotheism,
      based on Judaism, became the early creed of the new cosmopolitan Christian
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other legends, of a sort familiar in the lives of the founders of creeds
      and churches elsewhere, grew up about the life of the Christian leader; or
      at any rate, incidents of a typical kind were narrated by his disciples as
      part of his history. That a god or a godlike person should be born of a
      woman by the ordinary physiological processes of humanity seems derogatory
      to his dignity&mdash;perhaps fatal to his godhead: * therefore it was
      asserted&mdash;we know not whether truly or otherwise&mdash;that the
      founder of Christianity, by some mysterious afflatus, was born of a
      virgin. Though described at times as the son of one Joseph, a carpenter,
      of Nazareth, and of Mary, his betrothed wife, he was also regarded in an
      alternative way as the son of the Hebrew god Jahweh, just as Alexander,
      though known to be the son of Philip, was also considered to be the
      offspring of Amon-Ra or Zeus Ammon. We are told, in order to lessen this
      discrepancy (on the slender authority of a dream of Joseph&rsquo;s), how
      Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit of Jahweh in Mary&rsquo;s
      womb. He was further provided with a royal pedigree from the house of
      David, a real or mythical early Hebrew king; and prophecies from the
      Hebrew sacred books were found to be fulfilled in his most childish
      adventures. In one of the existing biographies, commonly ascribed to Luke,
      the companion of Paul, but supposed to bear traces of much later
      authorship, many such marvellous stories are recounted of his infantile
      adventures: and in all our documents, miracles attest his supernatural
      powers, while appeal is constantly made to the fulfilment of supposed
      predictions (all of old Hebrew origin) as a test and credential of the
      reality of his divine mission.

    <p>
      We <span class="pagenum">007</span><a name="link007" id="link007"></a>shall
      see hereafter that these two points&mdash;the gradual growth of a myth or
      legend, and affiliation upon earlier local religious ideas&mdash;are
      common features in the evolution of gods in general, and of the God of
      monotheism in particular. In almost every case where we can definitely
      track him to his rise, the deity thus begins with a Deified Man, elevated
      by his worshippers to divine rank, and provided with a history of
      miraculous incident, often connected with the personality of preexistent
      deities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the earlier stages, it seems pretty clear that the relations of nascent
      Christianity to Judaism were vague and undefined: the Christians regarded
      themselves as a mere sect of the Jews, who paid special reverence to a
      particular dead teacher, now raised to heaven by a special apotheosis of a
      kind with which everyone was then familiar. But as the Christian church
      spread to other lands, by the great seaports, it became on the one hand
      more distinct and exclusive, while on the other hand it became more
      definitely dogmatic and theological. It was in Egypt, it would seem, that
      the Christian Pantheon (if I may be allowed the expression in the case of
      a religion nominally monotheistic) first took its definite Trinitarian
      shape. Under the influence of the old Egyptian love for Triads or
      Trinities of gods, a sort of mystical triune deity was at last erected out
      of the Hebrew Jahweh and the man Jesus, with the aid of the Holy Spirit or
      Wisdom of Jahweh, which had come to be regarded by early Christian minds
      (under the influence of direct divine inspiration or otherwise) as a
      separate and coordinate person of this composite godhead. How far the
      familiar Egyptian Trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus may have influenced
      the conception of the Christian Trinity, thus finally made up of Father,
      Son, and Holy Ghost, we shall discuss at a later stage of our enquiry; for
      the present, it may suffice to point out that the Græco-Egyptian
      Athanasius was the great upholder of the definite dogma of the Trinity
      against opposing (heretical) Christian thinkers; and <span class="pagenum">008</span><a
      name="link008" id="link008"></a>that the hymn or so-called creed known by
      his name (though not in all probability of his own composition) bears the
      impress of the mystical Egyptian spirit, tempered by the Alexandrian Greek
      delight in definiteness and minuteness of philosophical distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect, too, we shall observe in the sequel that the history of
      Christianity, the most known among the religions, was exactly parallel to
      that of earlier and obscurer creeds. At first, the relations of the gods
      to one another are vague and undetermined; their pedigree is often
      confused and even contradictory; and the pantheon lacks anything like due
      hierarchical system or subordination of persons. But as time goes on, and
      questions of theology or mythology are debated among the priests and other
      interested parties, details of this sort get settled in the form of rigid
      dogmas, while subtle distinctions of a philosophical or metaphysical sort
      tend to be imported by more civilised men into the crude primitive faith.
      The belief that began with frank acceptance of Judaism, plus a personal
      worship of the Deified Man, Jesus, crystallised at last into the Catholic
      Faith in one God, of three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
      Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quibbles are even made, and discussions raised at last as to the question
      whether Father and Son are &ldquo;of one substance&rdquo; or only &ldquo;of
      like substance&rdquo;; whether the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and
      the Son, or from the Father only; and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was largely in other countries than Judæa, and especially in Gaul,
      Rome, and Egypt, too, as I believe, that symbolism came to the aid of
      mysticism: that the cross, the tau, the labarum, the fish, the Alpha and
      Omega, and all the other early Christian emblems were evolved and
      perfected; and that the beginnings of Christian art took their first
      definite forms. Such forms were especially to a great extent evolved in
      the Roman catacombs. Christianity, being a universal, not a local or
      national, religion, has <span class="pagenum">009</span><a name="link009"
      id="link009"></a>adopted in its course many diverse elements from most
      varied sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally, it would seem, the Christian pantheon was almost exclusively
      filled by the triune God, in his three developments or &ldquo;persons,&rdquo;
      as thus rigorously conceived by the Alexandrian intelligence. But from a
      very early time, if not from the first dawn of the Christian cult, it was
      customary to reverence the remains of those who had suffered for the
      faith, and perhaps even to invoke their aid with Christ and the Father.
      The Roman branch of the church, especially, accustomed to the Roman
      ancestor-worship and the Roman reverence for the Du Manes, had its chief
      places of prayer in the catacombs, where its dead were laid. Thus arose
      the practice of the invocation of saints, at whose graves or relics
      prayers were offered, both to the supreme deity and to the faithful dead
      themselves as intercessors with Christ and the Father. The early
      Christians, accustomed in their heathen stage to pay respect and even
      worship to the spirits of their deceased friends, could not immediately
      give up this pious custom after their conversion to the new creed, and so
      grafted it on to their adopted religion. Thus the subsidiary founders of
      Christianity, Paul, Peter, the Apostles, the Evangelists, the martyrs, the
      confessors, came to form, as it were, a subsidiary pantheon, and to rank
      to some extent almost as an inferior order of deities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the persons who thus shared in the honours of the new faith, the
      mother of Jesus early assumed a peculiar prominence. Goddesses had filled
      a very large part in the devotional spirit of the older religions: it was
      but natural that the devotees of Isis and Pasht, of Artemis and Aphrodite,
      should look for some corresponding object of feminine worship in the
      younger faith. The Theotokos, the mother of God, the blessed Madonna, soon
      came to possess a practical importance in Christian worship scarcely
      inferior to that enjoyed by the persons of the Trinity themselves&mdash;in
      certain southern countries, indeed, actually superior <span class="pagenum">010</span><a
      name="link010" id="link010"></a>to it. The Virgin and Child, in pictorial
      representation, grew to be the favourite subject of Christian art. How far
      this particular development of the Christian spirit had its origin in
      Egypt, and was related to the well-known Egyptian figures of the goddess
      Isis with the child Horus in her lap, is a question which may demand
      consideration in some future treatise. For the present, it will be enough
      to call attention in passing to the fact that in this secondary rank of
      deities or semi-divine persons, the saints and martyrs, all alike, from
      the Blessed Virgin Mary down to the newest canonised among Roman Catholic
      prelates, were at one time or another Living Men and Women. In other
      words, besides the one Deified Man, Jesus, round whom the entire system of
      Christianity centres, the Church now worships also in the second degree a
      whole host of minor Dead Men and Women, bishops, priests, virgins, and
      confessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the earliest to the latest ages of the Church, the complexity thus
      long ago introduced into her practice has gone on increasing with every
      generation. Nominally from the very outset a monotheistic religion,
      Christianity gave up its strict monotheism almost at the first start by
      admitting the existence of three persons in the godhead, whom it vainly
      endeavoured to unify by its mystic but confessedly incomprehensible
      Athanasian dogma. The Madonna (with the Child) rose in time practically to
      the rank of an independent goddess (in all but esoteric Catholic theory):
      while St. Sebastian, St. George, St. John Baptist, St. Catherine, and even
      St. Thomas of Canterbury himself, became as important objects of worship
      in certain places as the deity in person. At Milan, for example, San Carlo
      Borromeo, at Compostella, Santiago, at Venice, St. Mark, usurped to a
      great extent the place of the original God. As more and more saints died
      in each generation, while the cult of the older saints still lingered on
      everywhere more or less locally, the secondary pantheon grew ever fuller
      and fuller. Obscure personages, <span class="pagenum">011</span><a
      name="link011" id="link011"></a>like St. Crispin and St. Cosmas, St. Chad
      and St. Cuthbert rose to the rank of departmental or local patrons, like
      the departmental and local gods of earlier religions. Every trade, every
      guild, every nation, every province, had its peculiar saint. And at the
      same time, the theory of the Church underwent a constant evolution. Creed
      was added to creed&mdash;Apostles&rsquo;, Nicene, Athanasian, and so
      forth, each embodying some new and often subtle increment to the whole
      mass of accepted dogma. Council after council made fresh additions of
      articles of faith&mdash;the Unity of Substance, the Doctrine of the
      Atonement, the Immaculate Conception, the Authority of the Church, the
      Infallibility of the Pope in his spiritual capacity. And all these also
      are well-known incidents of every evolving cult: constant increase in the
      number of divine beings; constant refinements in the articles of religion,
      under the influence of priestly or scholastic metaphysics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three other points must still be noted in this hasty review of the
      evolution of Christianity, regarded as a standard of religion; and these I
      will now proceed to consider with all possible brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of ceremonial and certain other important accessories of
      religion it must frankly be admitted that Christianity rather borrowed
      from the older cults than underwent a natural and original development on
      its own account. A priesthood, as such, does not seem to have formed any
      integral or necessary part of the earliest Christendom: and when the
      orders of bishops, priests, and deacons were introduced into the new
      creed, the idea seems to have been derived rather from the existing
      priesthoods of anterior religions than from any organic connexion with the
      central facts of the new worship. From the very nature of the
      circumstances this would inevitably result. For the primitive temple (as
      we shall see hereafter) was the Dead Man&rsquo;s tomb; the altar was his
      gravestone; and the priest was the relative or representative who
      continued for him the customary gifts to the ghost <span class="pagenum">012</span><a
      name="link012" id="link012"></a>at the grave. But the case of Jesus
      differs from almost every other case on record of a Deified Man in this&mdash;that
      his body seems to have disappeared at an early date; and that, inasmuch as
      his resurrection and ascension into heaven were made the corner-stone of
      the new faith, it was impossible for worship of his remains to take the
      same form as had been taken in the instances of almost all previously
      deified Dead Persons. Thus, the materials out of which the Temple, the
      Altar, Sacrifices, Priesthood, are usually evolved (as we shall hereafter
      see) were here to a very large extent necessarily wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, so essential to religion in the minds of its followers are
      all these imposing and wonted accessories that our cult did actually
      manage to borrow them readymade from the great religions that went before
      it, and to bring them into some sort of artificial relation with its own
      system. You cannot revolutionize the human mind at one blow. The pagans
      had been accustomed to all these ideas as integral parts of religion as
      they understood it: and they proceeded as Christians to accommodate them
      by side-issues to the new faith, in which these elements had no such
      natural place as in the older creeds. Not only did sacred places arise at
      the graves or places of martyrdom of the saints; not only was worship
      performed beside the bones of the holy dead, in the catacombs and
      elsewhere; but even a mode of sacrifice and of sacrificial communion was
      invented in the mass,&mdash;a somewhat artificial development from the
      possibly unsacerdotal Agape-feasts of the primitive Christians. Gradually,
      churches gathered around the relics of the martyr saints: and in time it
      became a principle of usage that every church must contain an altar&mdash;made
      of stones on the analogy of the old sacred stones; containing the bones or
      other relics of a saint, like all earlier shrines; consecrated by the
      pouring on of oil after the antique fashion; and devoted to the
      celebration of the sacrifice of the mass, which became by degrees more and
      more expiatory and sacerdotal in <span class="pagenum">013</span><a
      name="link013" id="link013"></a>character. As the saints increased in
      importance, new holy places sprang up around their bodies; and some of
      these holy places, containing their tombs, became centres of pilgrimage
      for the most distant parts of Christendom; as did also in particular the
      empty tomb of Christ himself, the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem.

      The growth of the priesthood kept pace with the growth of ceremonial in
      general, till at last it culminated in the mediaeval papacy, with its
      hierarchy of cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, and other endless
      functionaries. Vestments, incense, and like accompaniments of
      sacerdotalism also rapidly gained ground. All this, too, is a common trait
      of higher religious evolution everywhere. So likewise are fasting, vigils,
      and the ecstatic condition. But asceticism, monasticism, celibacy, and
      other forms of morbid abstinence are peculiarly rife in the east, and
      found their highest expression in the life of the Syrian and Egyptian
      hermits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, a few words must be devoted in passing to the rise and development
      of the Sacred Books, now excessively venerated in North-western
      Christendom. These consisted in the first instance of genuine or spurious
      letters of the apostles to the various local churches (the so-called
      Epistles), some of which would no doubt be preserved with considerable
      reverence; and later of lives or legends of Jesus and his immediate
      successors (the so-called Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles).
      Furthermore, as Christianity adopted from Judaism the cult of its one
      supreme divine figure, now no longer envisaged as Jahweh, the national
      deity of the Hebrews, but as a universal cosmopolitan God and Father, it
      followed naturally that the sacred books of the Jewish people, the
      literature of Jahweh-worship, should also receive considerable attention
      at the hands of the new priesthood. By a gradual process of selection and
      elimination, the canon of scripture was evolved from these heterogeneous
      materials: the historical or quasi-historical and prophetic Hebrew <span
      class="pagenum">014</span><a name="link014" id="link014"></a>tracts were
      adopted by the Church, with a few additions of later date, such as the
      Book of Daniel, under the style and title of the Old Testament. The more
      generally accepted lives of Christ, again, known as Evangels or Gospels;
      the Acts of the Apostles; the epistles to the churches; and that curious
      mystical allegory of the Neronian persecution known as the Apocalypse,
      were chosen out of the mass of early Christian literature to form the
      authoritative collection of inspired writing which we call the New
      Testament. The importance of this heterogeneous anthology of works
      belonging to all ages and systems, but confounded together in popular
      fancy under the name of the Books, or more recently still as a singular
      noun, the Bible, grew apace with the growth of the Church: though the
      extreme and superstitions adoration of their mere verbal contents has only
      been reached in the debased and reactionary forms of Christianity followed
      at the present day by our half-educated English and American Protestant
      dissenters.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this very brief review of the most essential factors in the
      development of the Christian religion as a system, strung loosely together
      with a single eye to the requirements of our present investigation, it
      will be obvious at once to every intelligent reader that Christianity
      cannot possibly throw for us any direct or immediate light on the problem
      of the evolution of the idea of God. Not only did the concept of a god and
      gods exist full-fledged long before Christianity took its rise at all, but
      also the purely monotheistic conception of a single supreme God, the
      creator and upholder of all things, had been reached in all its sublime
      simplicity by the Jewish teachers centuries before the birth of the man
      Jesus. Christianity borrowed from Judaism this magnificent concept, and,
      humanly speaking, proceeded to spoil it by its addition of the Son and the
      Holy Ghost, who mar the complete unity of the grand Hebrew ideal. Even
      outside Judaism, the selfsame notion had already been arrived at in a
      certain mystical <span class="pagenum">015</span><a name="link015"
      id="link015"></a>form as the &ldquo;esoteric doctrine&rdquo; of the
      Egyptian priesthood; from whom, with their peculiar views as to emanations
      and Triads, the Christian dogmas of the Trinity, the Logos, the
      Incarnation, and the Holy Ghost were in large part borrowed. The Jews of
      Alexandria, that eastern London, formed the connecting link between
      Egyptian heathenism, Hellenic philosophy, and early Christianity; and
      their half-philosophical, half-religious ideas may be found permeating the
      first writings and the first systematic thought of the nascent church. In
      none of these ways, therefore, can we regard Christianity as affording us
      any direct or immediate guidance in our search for the origin and
      evolution of the concepts of many gods, and of one God the creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, in a certain secondary and illustrative sense, I think we are fully
      justified in saying that the history of Christianity, the religion whose
      beginnings are most surely known to us, forms a standard of reference for
      all the other religions of the world, and helps us indirectly to
      understand and explain the origin and evolution of these deepest among our
      fundamental spiritual conceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its value in this respect may best be understood if I point out briefly in
      two contrasted statements the points in which it may and the points in
      which it may not be fairly accepted as a typical religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us begin first with the points in which it may.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, Christianity is thoroughly typical in the fact that
      beyond all doubt its most central divine figure was at first, by common
      consent of orthodox and heterodox alike, nothing other than a particular
      Deified Man. All else that has been asserted about this particular Man&mdash;that
      he was the Son of God, that he was the incarnation of the Logos, that he
      existed previously from all eternity, that he sits now on the right hand
      of the Father&mdash;all the rest of these theological stories do nothing
      in any way to obscure the plain and universally admitted historical fact
      that this Divine Person, the Very God of Very God, being of one <span
      class="pagenum">016</span><a name="link016" id="link016"></a>substance
      with the Father, begotten of the Father before all worlds, was yet, at the
      moment when we first catch a glimpse of him in the writings of his
      followers, a Man recently deceased, respected, reverenced, and perhaps
      worshipped by a little group of fellow-peasants who had once known him as
      Jesus, the son of the carpenter. On that unassailable Rock of solid
      historical fact we may well be content to found our argument in this
      volume. Here at least nobody can accuse us of &ldquo;crude and gross
      Euhemerism.&rdquo; Or rather the crude and gross Euhemerism is here known
      to represent the solid truth. Jesus and his saints&mdash;Dominic, Francis,
      Catherine of Siena&mdash;are no mere verbal myths, no allegorical
      concepts, no personifications of the Sun, the Dawn, the Storm-cloud.
      Leaving aside for the present from our purview of the Faith that one
      element of the older supreme God&mdash;the Hebrew Jahweh,&mdash;whom
      Christianity borrowed from the earlier Jewish religion, we can say at
      least with perfect certainty that every single member of the Christian
      pantheon&mdash;Jesus, the Madonna, St. John Baptist, St. Peter, the
      Apostles, the Evangelists&mdash;were, just as much as San Carlo Borromeo
      or St. Thomas of Canterbury or St. Theresa, Dead Men or Women, worshipped
      after their death with divine or quasi-divine honours. In this the
      best-known of all human religions, the one that has grown up under the
      full eye of history, the one whose gods and saints are most distinctly
      traceable, every object of worship, save only the single early and as yet
      unresolved deity of the Hebrew cult, whose origin is lost for us in the
      mist of ages, turns out on enquiry to be indeed a purely Euhemeristic god
      or saint,&mdash;in ultimate analysis, a Real Man or Woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      That point alone I hold to be of cardinal importance, and of immense or
      almost inestimable illustrative value, in seeking for the origin of the
      idea of a god in earlier epochs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, Christianity is thoroughly typical in all that
      concerns its subsequent course of evolution; the gradual <span
      class="pagenum">017</span><a name="link017" id="link017"></a>elevation of
      its central Venerated Man into a God of the highest might and power; the
      multiplication of secondary deities or saints by worship or adoration of
      other Dead Men and Women; the growth of a graduated and duly subordinated
      hierarchy of divine personages; the rise of a legend, with its miracles
      and other supernatural adjuncts; the formation of a definite theology,
      philosophy, and systematic dogmatism; the development of special artistic
      forms, and the growth or adoption of appropriate symbolism; the production
      of sacred books, rituals, and formularies; the rise of ceremonies,
      mysteries, initiations, and sacraments; the reverence paid to relics,
      sacred sites, tombs, and dead bodies; and the close connexion of the
      religion as a whole with the ideas of death, the soul, the ghost, the
      spirit, the resurrection of the body, the last judgment, hell, heaven, the
      life everlasting, and all the other vast group of concepts which surround
      the simple fact of death in the primitive human mind generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the second place, let us look wherein Christianity to a certain
      small extent fails to be typical, or at least to solve our fundamental
      problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fails to be typical because it borrows largely a whole ready-made
      theology, and above all a single supreme God, from a pre-existent
      religion. In so far as it takes certain minor features from other cults,
      we can hardly say with truth that it does not represent the average run of
      religious systems; for almost every particular new creed so bases itself
      upon elements of still earlier faiths; and it is perhaps impossible for us
      at the present day to get back to anything like a really primitive or
      original form of cult. But Christianity is very far removed indeed from
      all primitive cults in that it accepts ready-made the monotheistic
      conception, the high-water-mark, so to speak, of religious philosophising.
      While in the frankness with which it exhibits to us what is practically
      one half of its supreme deity as a Galilean peasant of undoubted humanity,
      subsequently deified and etherealised, it allows us to get down at a
      single <span class="pagenum">018</span><a name="link018" id="link018"></a>step
      to the very origin of godhead; yet in the strength with which it asserts
      for the other half of its supreme deity (the Father, with his shadowy
      satellite the Holy Ghost) an immemorial antiquity and a complete severance
      from human life, it is the least anthropomorphic and the most abstract of
      creeds. In order to track the idea of God to its very source, then, we
      must apply in the last resort to this unresolved element of Christianity&mdash;the
      Hebrew Jahweh&mdash;the same sort of treatment which we apply to the
      conception of Jesus or Buddha;&mdash;we must show it to be also the
      immensely transfigured and magnified ghost of a Human Being; in the simple
      and forcible language of Swinburne, &ldquo;The shade cast by the soul of
      man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, Christianity fails to be typical in that it borrows also from
      pre-existing religions to a great extent the ideas of priesthood,
      sacrifice, the temple, the altar, which, owing to the curious
      disappearance or at least un-recognisability of the body of its founder
      (or, rather, its central object of worship), have a less natural place in
      our Christian system than in any other known form of religious practice.
      It is quite true that magnificent churches, a highly-evolved
      sacerdotalism, the sacrifice of the mass, the altar, and the relics, have
      all been imported in their fullest shape into developed Christianity,
      especially in its central or Roman form. But every one of these things is
      partly borrowed, almost as a survival or even as an alien feature, from
      earlier religions, and partly grew up about the secondary worship of
      saints and martyrs, their bones, their tombs, their catacombs, and their
      reliquaries. Christianity itself, particularly when viewed as the worship
      of Christ (to which it has been largely reduced in Teutonic Europe), does
      not so naturally lend itself to these secondary ceremonies; and in those
      debased schismatic forms of the Church which confine themselves most
      strictly to the worship of Jesus and of the supreme God, sacerdotalism and
      sacramentalism have been brought down to a minimum, <span class="pagenum">019</span><a
      name="link019" id="link019"></a>so that the temple and the altar have lost
      the greater part of their sacrificial importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I propose, then, in subsequent chapters, to trace the growth of the idea
      of a God from the most primitive origins to the most highly evolved forms;
      beginning with the ghost, and the early undeveloped deity: continuing
      through polytheism to the rise of monotheism; and then returning at last
      once more to the full Christian conception, which we shall understand far
      better in detail after we have explained the nature of the yet unresolved
      or but provisionally resolved Jehovistic element. I shall try to show, in
      short, the evolution of God, by starting with the evolution of gods in
      general, and coming down by gradual stages through various races to the
      evolution of the Hebrew, Christian, and Moslem God in particular. &lsquo;And
      the goal towards which I shall move will be the one already foreshadowed
      in this introductory chapter,&mdash;the proof that in its origin the
      concept of a god is nothing more than that of a Dead Man, regarded as a
      still surviving ghost or spirit, and endowed with increased or
      supernatural powers, and qualities.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;RELIGION AND MYTHOLOGY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t <span
      class="pagenum">020</span><a name="link020" id="link020"></a>the very
      outset of the profound enquiry on which we are now about to embark, we are
      met by a difficulty of considerable magnitude. In the opinion of most
      modern mythologists mythology is the result of &ldquo;a disease of
      language.&rdquo; We are assured by many eminent men that the origin of
      religion is to be sought, not in savage ideas about ghosts and spirits,
      the Dead Man and his body or his surviving double, but in primitive
      misconceptions of the meaning of words which had reference to the
      appearance of the Sun and the Clouds, the Wind and the Rain, the Dawn and
      the Dusk, the various phenomena of meteorology in general. If this be so,
      then our attempt to derive the evolution of gods from the crude ideas of
      early men about their dead is clearly incorrect; the analogy of
      Christianity which we have already alleged is a mere will o&rsquo; the
      wisp; and the historical Jesus himself may prove in the last resort to be
      an alias of the sun-god or an embodiment of the vine-spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not believe these suggestions are correct. It seems to me that the
      worship of the sun, moon, and stars, instead of being an element in
      primitive religion, is really a late and derivative type of adoration; and
      that mythology is mistaken in the claims it makes for its own importance
      in the genesis of the idea of a God or gods. In order, however, to clear
      the ground for a fair start in this direction, we ought, I think, to begin
      by enquiring into the relative positions of mythology and religion. I
      shall therefore <span class="pagenum">021</span><a name="link021"
      id="link021"></a>devote a preliminary chapter to the consideration of this
      important subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religion, says another group of modern thinkers, of whom Mr. Edward Clodd
      is perhaps the most able English exponent, &ldquo;grew out of fear.&rdquo;
      It is born of man&rsquo;s terror of the great and mysterious natural
      agencies by which he is surrounded. Now I am not concerned to deny that
      many mythological beings of various terrible forms do really so originate.
      I would readily accept some such vague genesis for many of the dragons and
      monsters which abound in all savage or barbaric imaginings&mdash;for
      Gorgons and Hydras and Chimæras dire, and other manifold shapes of the
      superstitiously appalling. I would give up to Mr. Clodd the Etruscan
      devils and the Hebrew Satan, the Grendels and the Fire-drakes, the whole
      brood of Cerberus, Briareus, the Cyclops, the Centaurs. None of these,
      however, is a god or anything like one. They have no more to do with
      religion, properly so called, than the unicorn of the royal arms has to do
      with British Christianity. A god, as I understand the word, and as the
      vast mass of mankind has always understood it, is a supernatural being to
      be revered and worshipped. He stands to his votaries, on the whole, as Dr.
      Robertson Smith has well pointed out, in a kindly and protecting relation.
      He may be angry with them at times, to be sure; but his anger is temporary
      and paternal alone: his permanent attitude towards his people is one of
      friendly concern; he is worshipped as a beneficent and generous Father. It
      is the origin of gods in this strictest sense that concerns us here, not
      the origin of those vague and formless creatures which are dreaded, not
      worshipped, by primitive humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bearing this distinction carefully in mind, let us proceed to consider the
      essentials of religion. If you were to ask almost any intelligent and
      unsophisticated child, &ldquo;What is religion?&rdquo; he would answer
      offhand, with the clear vision of youth, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s saying your
      prayers, and heading your Bible, and singing hymns, and going to church
      <span class="pagenum">022</span><a name="link022" id="link022"></a>or to
      chapel on Sundays.&rdquo; If you were to ask any intelligent and
      unsophisticated Hindu peasant the same question, he would answer in almost
      the self-same spirit, &ldquo;Oh, it is doing poojah regularly, and paying
      your dues every day to Mahadeo.&rdquo; If you were to ask any
      simple-minded African savage, he would similarly reply, &ldquo;It is
      giving the gods flour, and oil, and native beer, and goat-mutton,&rdquo;
      And finally if you were to ask a devout Italian contadino, he would
      instantly say, &ldquo;It is offering up candles and prayers to the
      Madonna, attending mass, and remembering the saints on every festa.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And they would all be quite right. This, in its essence, is precisely what
      we call religion. Apart from the special refinements of the higher minds
      in particular creeds, which strive to import into it all, according to
      their special tastes or fancies, a larger or smaller dose of philosophy,
      or of metaphysics, or of ethics, or of mysticism, this is just what
      religion means and has always meant to the vast majority of the human
      species. What is common to it throughout is Custom or Practice: a certain
      set of more or less similar Observances: propitiation, prayer, praise,
      offerings: the request for divine favours, the deprecation of divine anger
      or other misfortunes: and as the outward and visible adjuncts of all
      these, the altar, the sacrifice, the temple, the church; priesthood,
      services, vestments, ceremonial.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is not at all essential to religion in its wider aspect&mdash;taking
      the world round, both past and present, Pagan, Buddhist, Mohammadan,
      Christian, savage, and civilised&mdash;is the ethical element, properly so
      called. And what is very little essential indeed is the philosophical
      element, theology or mythology, the abstract theory of spiritual
      existences. This theory, to be sure, is in each country or race closely
      related with religion under certain aspects; and the stories told about
      the gods or God are much mixed up with the cult itself in the minds of
      worshippers; but they are no proper part of religion, strictly so called.
      In a single word, I contend that religion, as such, is essentially <span
      class="pagenum">023</span><a name="link023" id="link023"></a>practical:
      theology or mythology, as such, is essentially theoretical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, I also believe, and shall attempt to show, that the two have to
      a large extent distinct origins and roots: that the union between them is
      in great part adventitious: and that, therefore, to account for or explain
      the one is by no means equivalent to accounting for and explaining the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank recognition of this difference of origin between religion and
      mythology would, I imagine, largely reconcile the two conflicting schools
      of thought which at present divide opinion between them on this
      interesting problem in the evolution of human ideas. On the one side, we
      have the mythological school of interpreters, whether narrowly linguistic,
      like Professor Max Müller, or broadly anthropological, like Mr. Andrew
      Lang, attacking the problem from the point of view of myth or theory
      alone. On the other side, we have the truly religious school of
      interpreters, like Mr. Herbert Spencer, and to some extent Mr. Tylor,
      attacking the problem from the point of view of practice or real religion.
      The former school, it seems to me, has failed to perceive that what it is
      accounting for is not the origin of religion at all&mdash;of worship,
      which is the central-root idea of all religious observance, or of the
      temple, the altar, the priest, and the offering, which are its outer
      expression&mdash;but merely the origin of myth or fable, the mass of story
      and legend about various beings, real or imaginary, human or divine, which
      naturally grows up in every primitive community. The latter school, on the
      other hand, while correctly interpreting the origin of all that is
      essential and central in religion, have perhaps underestimated the value
      of their opponents&rsquo; work through regarding it as really opposed to
      their own, instead of accepting what part of it may be true in the light
      of a contribution to an independent but allied branch of the same enquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, if the view here suggested be correct, Spencer and <span
      class="pagenum">024</span><a name="link024" id="link024"></a>Tylor have
      paved the way to a true theory of the Origin of Religion; Max Müller,
      Lang, and the other mythologists have thrown out hints of varying value
      towards a true theory of the Origin of Mythology, or of its more modern
      equivalent and successor, Theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brief outline of facts will serve to bring into clearer relief this view
      of religion as essentially practical&mdash;a set of observances, rendered
      inevitable by the primitive data of human psychology. It will then be seen
      that what is fundamental and essential in religion is the body of
      practices, remaining throughout all stages of human development the same,
      or nearly the same, in spite of changes of mythological or theological
      theory; and that what is accidental and variable is the particular verbal
      explanation or philosophical reason assigned for the diverse rites and
      ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its simplest surviving savage type, religion consists wholly and solely
      in certain acts of deference paid by the living to the persons of the
      dead. I shall try to show in the sequel that down to its most highly
      evolved modern type in the most cultivated societies, precisely similar
      acts of deference, either directly to corpses or ghosts as such, or
      indirectly to gods who were once ghosts, or were developed from ghosts,
      form its essence still. But to begin with I will try to bring a few simple
      instances of the precise nature of religion in its lowest existing savage
      mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might if I chose take my little collection of illustrative facts from
      some theoretical writer, like Mr. Herbert Spencer, who has collected
      enough instances in all conscience to prove this point; but I prefer to go
      straight to an original observer of savage life and habit, a Presbyterian
      missionary in Central Africa&mdash;the Rev. Duff Macdonald, author of <i>Africana</i>&mdash;who
      had abundant opportunities at the Blantyre Mission for learning the ideas
      and practice of the Soudanese natives, and who certainly had no theoretic
      predisposition towards resolving all religious notions into <span
      class="pagenum">025</span><a name="link025" id="link025"></a>the primitive
      respect and reverence for the dead or the worship of ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in outline, but in Mr. Macdonald&rsquo;s own words, are the ideas
      and observances which this careful and accurate investigator found current
      among the tribes of the heart of Africa. &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; he
      says, &ldquo;I have admitted any point of importance without having heard
      at least four natives on the subject. The statements are translations, as
      far as possible, from the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the negroes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tribes he lived among &ldquo;are unanimous in saying that there is
      something beyond the body which they call spirit. Every human body at
      death is forsaken by this spirit.&rdquo; That is the almost universal
      though not quite primitive belief, whose necessary genesis has been well
      traced out by Mr. Herbert Spencer, and more recently in America with great
      vigour and clearness by Mr. Lester Ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do these spirits ever die?&rdquo; Mr. Macdonald asks. &ldquo;Some,&rdquo;
      he answers, &ldquo;I have heard affirm that it is possible for a
      troublesome spirit to be killed. Others give this a direct denial. Many,
      like Kumpama, or Cherasulo, say, &lsquo;You ask me whether a man&rsquo;s
      spirit ever dies. I cannot tell. I have never been in the spirit-world,
      but this I am certain of, that spirits live for a very long time.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the question, &ldquo;Who the gods are?&rdquo; Mr. Macdonald says:
      &ldquo;In all our translations of Scripture where we found the word God we
      used <i>Mulungu</i>; but this word is chiefly used by the natives as a
      general name for spirit. The spirit of a deceased man is called his
      Mulungu, and all the prayers and offerings of the living are presented to
      such spirits of the dead. It is here that we find the great centre of the
      native religion. The spirits of the dead are the gods of the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are these gods found? At the grave? No. The villagers shrink
      from yonder gloomy place that lies far beyond their fields on the bleak
      mountain side. It is only <span class="pagenum">026</span><a name="link026"
      id="link026"></a>when they have to lay another sleeper beside his
      forefathers that they will go there. Their god is not the body in the
      grave, but the spirit, and they seek this spirit at the place where their
      departed kinsman last lived among them. It is the great tree at the
      verandah of the dead man&rsquo;s house that is their temple; and if no
      tree grow here they erect a little shade, and there perform their simple
      rites. If this spot become too public, the offerings may be defiled, and
      the sanctuary will be removed to a carefully-selected spot under some
      beautiful tree. Very frequently a man presents an offering at the top of
      his own bed beside his head. He wishes his god to come to him and whisper
      in his ear as he sleeps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, again, we get the origin of nature-worship:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirit of an old chief may have a whole mountain for his
      residence, but he dwells chiefly on the cloudy summit. There he sits to
      receive the worship of his votaries, and to send down the refreshing
      showers in answer to their prayers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as essential to religion as these prime factors in its evolution&mdash;the
      god, worship, offerings, presents, holy places, temples&mdash;is the
      existence of a priesthood. Here is how the Central Africans arrive at that
      special function:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A certain amount of etiquette is observed in approaching the gods.
      In no case can a little boy or girl approach these deities, neither can
      anyone that has not been at the mysteries. The common qualification is
      that a person has attained a certain age, about twelve or fourteen years,
      and has a house of his own. Slaves seldom pray, except when they have had
      a dream. Children that have had a dream tell their mother, who approaches
      the deity on their behalf. (A present for the god is necessary, and the
      slave or child may not have it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apart from the case of dreams and a few such private matters, it is
      not usual for anyone to approach the gods except the chief, of the
      village. He is the recognised high priest <span class="pagenum">027</span><a
      name="link027" id="link027"></a>who presents prayers and offerings on
      behalf of all that live in his village. If the chief is from home his wife
      will act, and if both are absent, his younger brother. The natives worship
      not so much individually as in villages or communities. Their religion is
      more a public than a private matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are also further reasons why priests are necessary. Relationship
      forms always a good ground for intercession. A mediator is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chief of a village,&rdquo; says Mr. Macdonald, &ldquo;has
      another title to the priesthood. It is his relatives that are the village
      gods. Everyone that lives in the village recognises these gods; but if
      anyone remove to another village he changes his gods. He recognises now
      the gods of his new chief. One wishing to pray to the god (or gods) of any
      village naturally desires to have his prayers presented through the
      village chief, because the latter is nearly related to the village god,
      and may be expected to be better listened to than a stranger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little further on Mr. Macdonald says: &ldquo;On the subject of the
      village gods opinions differ. Some say that every one in the village,
      whether a relative of the chief or not, must worship the forefathers of
      the chief. Others say that a person not related to the chief must worship
      his own forefathers, otherwise their spirits will bring trouble upon him.
      To reconcile these authorities we may mention that nearly everyone in the
      village is related to its chief, or if not related is, in courtesy,
      considered so. Any person not related to the village chief would be polite
      enough on all public occasions to recognise the village god: on occasions
      of private prayer (which are not so numerous as in Christendom) he would
      approach the spirits of his own forefathers. Besides, there might be a god
      of the land. The chief Kapeni prays to his own relatives, and also to the
      old gods of the place. His own relatives he approaches himself; the other
      deities he may also approach himself, but he often <span class="pagenum">028</span><a
      name="link028" id="link028"></a>finds people more closely related and
      consequently more acceptable to the old gods of the land.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The African pantheon is thus widely peopled. Elimination and natural
      selection next give one the transition from the ghost to the god, properly
      so called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gods of the natives then are nearly as numerous as their dead.
      It is impossible to worship all; a selection must be made, and, as we have
      indicated, each worshipper turns most naturally to the spirits of his own
      departed relatives; but his gods are too many still, and in farther
      selecting he turns to those that have lived nearest his own time. Thus the
      chief of a village will not trouble himself about his
      great-great-grandfather: he will present his offering to his own immediate
      predecessor, and say, &lsquo;O father, I do not know all your relatives,
      you know them all, invite them to feast with you.&rsquo; The offering is
      not simply for himself, but for himself and all his relatives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinary ghosts are soon forgotten with the generation that knew them. Not
      so a few select spirits, the Cæsars and Napoleons, the Charlemagnes and
      Timurs of savage empires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great chief that has been successful in his wars does not pass
      out of memory so soon. He may become the god of a mountain or a lake, and
      may receive homage as a local deity long after his own descendants have
      been driven from the spot. When there is a supplication for rain the
      inhabitants of the country pray not so much to their own forefathers as to
      the god of yonder mountain on whose shoulders the great rain-clouds
      repose. (Smaller hills are seldom honoured with a deity.)&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, in all this we get, it seems to me, the very essentials and
      universals of religion generally,&mdash;the things without which no
      religion could exist&mdash;the vital part, without the ever-varying and
      changeable additions of mere gossiping mythology. In the presents brought
      to the dead man&rsquo;s grave to appease the ghost, we have the central
      element of all worship, the practical key of all cults, past or present.
    </p>
    <p>
      On <span class="pagenum">029</span><a name="link029" id="link029"></a>the
      other hand, mythologists tell us nothing about the origin of prayer and
      sacrifice: they put us off with stories of particular gods, without
      explaining to us how those gods ever came to be worshipped. Now, mythology
      is a very interesting study in its own way: but to treat as religion a
      mass of stories and legends about gods or saints, with hardly a single
      living element of practice or sacrifice, seems to me simply to confuse two
      totally distinct branches of human enquiry. The Origin of Tales has
      nothing at all to do with the Origin of Worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we come to read Mr. Macdonald&rsquo;s account of a native funeral, on
      the other hand, we are at once on a totally different tack; we can
      understand, as by an electric flash, the genesis of the primitive acts of
      sacrifice and religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Along with the deceased is buried a considerable part of his
      property. We have already seen that his bed is buried with him; so also
      are all his clothes. If he possesses several tusks of ivory, one tusk or
      more is ground to a powder between two stones and put beside him. Beads
      are also ground down in the same way. These precautions are taken to
      prevent the witch (who is supposed to be answerable for his death) from
      making any use of the ivory or beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the deceased owned several slaves, an enormous hole is dug for a
      grave. The slaves are now brought forward. They may be either cast into
      the pit alive, or the undertakers may cut all their throats. The body of
      their master or their mistress is then laid down to rest above theirs, and
      the grave is covered in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this the women come forward with the offerings of food, and
      place them at the head of the grave. The dishes in which the food was
      brought are left behind. The pot that held the drinking-water of the
      deceased and his drinking-cup are also left with him. These, too, might be
      coveted by the witch, but a hole is pierced in the pot, and the drinking
      calabash is broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <span class="pagenum">030</span><a name="link030" id="link030"></a>man
      has now gone from the society of the living, and he is expected to share
      the meal thus left at his grave with those that have gone before him. The
      funeral party breaks up; they do not want to visit the grave of their
      friend again without a very good reason. Anyone found among the graves may
      be taken for a cannibal. Their friend has become a citizen of a different
      village. He is with all his relatives of the past. He is entitled to
      offerings or presents which may come to him individually or through his
      chief. These offerings in most cases he will share with others, just as he
      used to do when alive,&rdquo; Sometimes the man may be buried in his own
      hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this case the house is not taken down, but is generally covered
      with cloth, and the verandah becomes the place for presenting offerings.
      His old house thus becomes a kind of temple.... The deceased is now in the
      spirit-world, and receives offerings and adoration. He is addressed as
      &lsquo;Our great spirit that has gone before.&rsquo; If anyone dream of
      him. it is at once concluded that the spirit is &lsquo;up to something.&rsquo;
      Very likely he wants to have some of the survivors for his companions. The
      dreamer hastens to appease the spirit by an offering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So real is this society of the dead that Mr. Macdonald says: &ldquo;The
      practice of sending messengers to the world beyond the grave is found on
      the West Coast. A chief summons a slave, delivers to him a message, and
      then cuts off his head. If the chief forget anything that he wanted to
      say, he sends another slave as a postscript.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have quoted at such length from this recent and extremely able work
      because I want to bring into strong relief the fact that we have here
      going on under our very eyes, from day to day, <i>de novo</i>, the entire
      genesis of new gods and goddesses, and of all that is most central and
      essential to religion&mdash;worship, prayer, the temple, the altar,
      priesthood, sacrifice. Nothing that the mythologists can tell us about the
      Sun or the Moon, the Dawn or the Stormcloud, <span class="pagenum">031</span><a
      name="link031" id="link031"></a>Little Red Riding Hood or Cinderella and
      the Glass Slipper, comes anywhere near the Origin of Religion in these its
      central and universal elements. Those stories or guesses may be of immense
      interest and importance as contributions to the history of ideas in our
      race; but nothing we can learn about the savage survival in the myth of
      Cupid or Psyche, or about the primitive cosmology in the myth of the
      children of Kronos, helps us to get one inch nearer the origin of God or
      of prayer, of worship, of religious ceremonial, of the temple, the church,
      the sacrifice, the mass, or any other component part of what we really
      know as Religion in the concrete. These myths may be sometimes philosophic
      guesses, sometimes primitive folk-tales, but they certainly are not the
      truths of Religion. On the other hand, the living facts, here so simply
      detailed by a careful, accurate, and unassuming observer, strengthened by
      the hundreds of similar facts collected by Tylor, Spencer, and others, do
      help us at once to understand the origin of the central core and kernel of
      religion as universally practised all the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, omitting for the present the mythological and cosmological factor,
      which so often comes in to obscure the plain religious facts in missionary
      narrative or highly-coloured European accounts of native beliefs, what do
      we really find as the underlying truths of all religion? That all the
      world over practices essentially similar to those of these savage Central
      Africans prevail among mankind; practices whose affiliation upon the same
      primitive ideas has been abundantly proved by Mr. Herbert Spencer;
      practices which have for their essence the propitiation or adulation of a
      spiritual being or beings, derived from ghosts, and conceived of as
      similar, in all except the greatness of the connoted attributes, to the
      souls of men. &ldquo;Whenever the [Indian] villagers are questioned about
      their creed,&rdquo; says Sir William Hunter, &ldquo;the same answer is
      invariably given: &lsquo;The common people have no idea of religion, <span
      class="pagenum">032</span><a name="link032" id="link032"></a>but to do
      right [ceremonially] and to worship the village god.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, I maintain that religion is not mainly, as the mistaken analogy
      of Christian usage makes us erroneously call it, Faith or Creed, but
      simply and solely Ceremony, Custom, or Practice. And I am glad to say
      that, for early Semitic times at least, Professor Robertson Smith is of
      the same opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one looks at the vast mass of the world, ancient and modern, it is
      quite clear that religion consists, and has always consisted, of
      observances essentially similar to those just described among the Central
      African tribes. Its core is worship. Its centre is the God&mdash;that is
      to say, the Dead Ancestor or Relative. The religion of China is to this
      day almost entirely one of pure ancestor-cult. The making of offerings and
      burning of joss-paper before the Family Dead form its principal
      ceremonies. In India, while the three great gods of the mystical
      Brahmanist philosophy are hardly worshipped in actual practice at all,
      every community and every house has its own particular gods and its own
      special cult of its little domestic altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first Englishman,&rdquo; says Sir William Hunter, &ldquo;who
      tried to study the natives as they actually are, and not as the Brahmans
      described them, was struck by the universal prevalence of a worship quite
      distinct from that of the Hindu deities. A Bengal village has usually its
      local god, which it adores either in the form of a rude unhewn stone, or a
      stump, or a tree marked with red-lead. Sometimes a lump of clay placed
      under a tree does duty for a deity, and the attendant priest, when there
      is one, generally belongs to one of the half-Hinduised low-castes. The
      rude stone represents the non-Aryan fetish; and the tree seems to owe its
      sanctity to the non-Aryan belief that it forms the abode of the ghosts, or
      gods, of the village.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Omitting the mere guesswork about the fetish and the gratuitous
      supposition, made out of deference to the dying creed of Max-Müllerism,
      that ancestor-worship must necessarily <span class="pagenum">033</span><a
      name="link033" id="link033"></a>be a &ldquo;non-Aryan&rdquo; feature
      (though it exists or existed in all so-called Aryan races), this simple
      description shows us the prevalence over the whole of India of customs
      essentially similar to those which obtain in Central Africa and in the
      Chinese provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman religion, in somewhat the same way, separates itself at once
      into a civic or national and a private or family cult. There were the
      great gods, native or adopted, whom the State worshipped publicly, as the
      Central African tribes worship the chiefs ancestors; and there were the
      Lares and Penates, whom the family worshipped at its own hearth, and whose
      very name shows them to have been in origin and essence ancestral spirits.
      And as the real or practical Hindu religion consists mainly of offering up
      rice, millet, and ghee to the little local and family deities or to the
      chosen patron god in the Brahmanist pantheon, so, too, the real or
      practical Roman religion consisted mainly of sacrifice done at the
      domestic altar to the special Penates, <i>farre pio et saliente mica</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not go on to point out in detail at the present stage of our
      argument how Professor Sayce similarly finds ancestor-worship and
      Shamanism (a low form of ghost-propitiation) at the root of the religion
      of the ancient Ac-cadians; how other observers have performed the same
      task for the Egyptians and Japanese; and how like customs have been traced
      among Greeks and Amazulu, among Hebrews and Nicaraguans, among early
      English and Digger Indians, among our Aryan ancestors themselves and
      Andaman Islanders. Every recent narrative of travel abounds with examples.
      Of Netherland Island I read, &ldquo;The skulls of their ancestors were
      treasured for gods of the New Hebrides, &ldquo;The people worshipped the
      spirits of their ancestors. They prayed to them, over the kava-bowl, for
      health and prosperity.&rdquo; In New Caledonia, &ldquo;Their gods were
      their ancestors, whose relics they kept up and idolised.&rdquo; At Tana,
      &ldquo;The general name for gods seemed to be <i>aremha</i>; that means a
      <i>dead man</i>, and hints,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">034</span><a
      name="link034" id="link034"></a>says the Rev. George Turner, with pleasing
      frankness, &ldquo;alike at the origin and nature of their religious
      worship.&rdquo; When the chief prayed, he offered up yam and fruits,
      saying, &ldquo;Compassionate father, here is some food for you; eat it. Be
      kind to us on account of it.&rdquo; Those who wish to see the whole of the
      evidence on this matter marshalled in battle array have only to turn to
      the first volume of Mr. Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s <i>Principles of Sociology</i>,
      where they will find abundant examples from all times and places gathered
      together in a vast and overwhelming phalanx.
    </p>
    <p>
      What concerns us in this chapter a little more is to call attention by
      anticipation to the fact that even in Christianity itself the same
      primitive element survives as the centre of all that is most distinctively
      religious, as opposed to theological, in the Christian religion. And I
      make these remarks provisionally here in order that the reader may the
      better understand to what ultimate goal our investigation will lead him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the universal Catholic custom to place the relics of saints or
      martyrs under the altars in churches. Thus the body of St. Mark the
      Evangelist lies under the high altar of St. Mark&rsquo;s, at Venice; and
      in every other Italian cathedral, or chapel, a reliquary is deposited
      within the altar itself. So well understood is this principle in the Latin
      Church, that it has hardened into the saying, &ldquo;No relic, no altar.&rdquo;
      The sacrifice of the mass takes place at such an altar, and is performed
      by a priest in sacrificial robes. The entire Roman Catholic ritual is a
      ritual derived from the earlier sacerdotal ideas of ministry at an altar,
      and its connection with the primitive form is still kept up by the
      necessary presence of human remains in its holy places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the very idea of a church itself is descended from the early
      Christian meeting-places in the catacombs or at the tombs of the martyrs,
      which are universally allowed to have been the primitive Christian altars.
      <span class="pagenum">035</span><a name="link035" id="link035"></a>We know
      now that the cruciform dome-covered plan of Christian churches is derived
      from these early meeting-places at the junction of lanes or alleys in the
      catacombs; that the nave, chancel, and transepts indicate the crossing of
      the alleys, while the dome represents the hollowed-out portion or rudely
      circular vault where the two lines of archway intersect. The earliest
      dome-covered churches were attempts, as it were, to construct a catacomb
      above ground for the reception of the altar-tomb of a saint or martyr.
      Similarly with the chapels that open out at the side from the aisles or
      transepts. Etymologically, the word chapel is the modernised form of <i>capella</i>,
      the arched sepulchre excavated in the walls of the catacombs, before the
      tomb at which it was usual to offer up prayer and praise. The chapels
      built out from the aisles in Roman churches, each with its own altar and
      its own saintly relics, are attempts to reproduce above ground in the same
      way the original sacred places in the early Christian excavated
      cemeteries. We will recur to this subject at much greater length in
      subsequent chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Christianity itself is linked on to the very antique custom of
      worship at tombs, and the habit of ancestor-worship by altars, relics, and
      invocation of saints, even revolutionary Protestantism still retaining
      some last faint marks of its origin in the dedication of churches to
      particular evangelists or martyrs, and in the more or less disguised
      survival of altar, priesthood, sacrifice, and vestments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I do not say ancestor-worship gives us the whole origin of everything
      that is included in Christian English minds in the idea of religion. I do
      not say it accounts for all the cosmologies and cosmogonies of savage,
      barbaric, or civilised tribes. Those, for the most part, are pure
      mythological products, explicable mainly, I believe, by means of the key
      with which mythology supplies us; and one of them, adopted into Genesis
      from an alien source, has come to be accepted by modern Christendom as
      part of <span class="pagenum">036</span><a name="link036" id="link036"></a>that
      organised body of belief which forms the Christian creed, though not in
      any true sense the Christian religion. Nor do I say that ancestor-worship
      gives us the origin of those ontological, metaphysical, or mystical
      conceptions which form part of the philosophy or theology of many
      priesthoods. Religions, as we generally get them envisaged for us
      nowadays, are held to include the mythology, the cosmogony, the ontology,
      and even the ethics of the race that practises them. These extraneous
      developments, however, I hold to spring from different roots and to have
      nothing necessarily in common with religion proper. The god is the true
      crux. If we have once accounted for the origin of ghosts, gods, tombs,
      altars, temples, churches, worship, sacrifice, priesthoods, and
      ceremonies, then we have accounted for all that is essential and central
      in religion, and may hand over the rest&mdash;the tales, stories, and
      pious legends&mdash;to the account of comparative mythology or of the yet
      unfounded science of comparative idealogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, I do not wish to insist, either, that every particular and
      individual god, national or naturalistic, must necessarily represent a
      particular ghost&mdash;the dead spirit of a single definite once-living
      person. It is enough to show, as Mr. Spencer has shown, that the idea of
      the god, and the worship paid to a god, are directly derived from the idea
      of the ghost, and the offerings made to the ghost, without necessarily
      holding, as Mr. Spencer seems to hold, that every god is and must be in
      ultimate analysis the ghost of a particular human being. Once the
      conception of gods had been evolved by humanity, and had become a common
      part of every man&rsquo;s imagined universe&mdash;of the world as it
      presented itself to the mind of the percipient&mdash;then it was natural
      enough that new gods should be made from time to time out of abstractions
      or special aspects and powers of nature, and that the same worship should
      be paid to such new-made and purely imaginary gods as had previously been
      paid to the whole host of gods <span class="pagenum">037</span><a
      name="link037" id="link037"></a>evolved from personal and tribal
      ancestors. It is the first step that costs: once you have got the idea of
      a god fairly evolved, any number of extra gods may be invented or
      introduced from all quarters. A great pantheon readily admits new members
      to its ranks from, many strange sources. Familiar instances in one of the
      best-known pantheons are those of Concordia, Pecunia, Aius Locutius,
      Rediculus Tutanus. The Romans, indeed, deified every conceivable operation
      of nature or of human life; they had gods or goddesses for the minutest
      details of agriculture, of social relations, of the first years of
      childhood, of marriage and domestic arrangements generally. Many of their
      deities, as we shall see hereafter, were obviously manufactured to meet a
      special demand on special occasions. But at the same time, none of these
      gods, so far as we can judge, could ever have come to exist at all if the
      ghost-theory and ancestor-worship had not already made familiar to the
      human mind the principles and practice of religion generally. The very
      idea of a god could not otherwise have been evolved; though, when once
      evolved, any number of new beings could readily be affiliated upon it by
      the human imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, to admit that other elements have afterwards come in to confuse
      religion is quite a different thing from admitting that religion itself
      has more than one origin. Whatever gives us the key to the practice of
      worship gives us the key to all real religion. Now, one may read through
      almost any books of the mythological school without ever coming upon a
      single word that throws one ray of light upon the origin of religion
      itself thus properly called. To trace the development of this, that, or
      the other story or episode in a religious myth is in itself a very
      valuable study in human evolution: but no amount of tracing such stories
      ever gives us the faintest clue to the question why men worshipped Osiris,
      Zeus, Siva, or Venus; why they offered up prayer and praise to Isis, or to
      Artemis; why they made sacrifices of oxen to Capitolian Jove <span
      class="pagenum">038</span><a name="link038" id="link038"></a>at Rome, or
      slew turtle-doves on the altar of Jahweh, god of Israel, at Jerusalem. The
      ghost-theory and the practice of ancestor-worship show us a natural basis
      and genesis for all these customs, and explain them in a way to which no
      mythological enquiry can add a single item of fundamental interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be well at this point to attempt beforehand some slight provisional
      disentanglement of the various extraneous elements which interweave
      themselves at last with the simple primitive fabric of practical religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, there is the mythological element. The mythopoeic
      faculty is a reality in mankind. Stories arise, grow, gather episodes with
      movement, transform and transmute themselves, wander far in space, get
      corrupted by time, in ten thousand ways suffer change and modification.
      Now, such stories sometimes connect themselves with living men and women.
      Everybody knows how many myths exist even in our own day about every
      prominent or peculiar person. They also gather more particularly round the
      memory of the dead, and especially of any very distinguished dead man or
      woman. Sometimes they take their rise in genuine tradition, sometimes they
      are pure fetches of fancy or of the romancing faculty. The ghosts or the
      gods are no less exempt from these mythopoic freaks than other people; and
      as gods go on living indefinitely, they have plenty of time for myths to
      gather about them. Most often, a myth is invented to account for some
      particular religious ceremony. Again, myths demonstrably older than a
      particular human being&mdash;say Cæsar, Virgil, Arthur, Charlemagne&mdash;may
      get fitted by later ages to those special personalities. The same thing
      often happens also with gods. Myth comes at last, in short, to be the
      history of the gods; and a personage about whom many myths exist, whether
      real or imaginary, a personification of nature or an abstract quality, may
      grow in time to be practically a divine being, and even perhaps to receive
      worship, the final test of divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, <span class="pagenum">039</span><a name="link039" id="link039"></a>myths
      about the gods come in the long run, in many cases, to be written down,
      especially by the priests, and themselves acquire a considerable degree of
      adventitious holiness. Thus we get Sacred Books; and in most advanced
      races, the sacred books tend to become an important integral part of
      religion, and a test of the purity of tenets or ceremonial. But sacred
      books almost always contain rude cosmological guesses and a supernatural
      cosmogony, as well as tales about the doings, relationships, and
      prerogatives of the gods. Such early philosophical conjectures come then
      to be intimately bound up with the idea of religion, and in many cases
      even to supersede in certain minds its true, practical, central kernel.
      The extreme of this tendency is seen in English Protestant Dissenting
      Bibliolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rationalistic and reconciliatory glosses tend to arise with advancing
      culture. Attempts are made to trace the pedigree and mutual relations of
      the gods, and to get rid of discrepancies in earlier legends. The Theogony
      of Hesiod is a definite effort undertaken in this direction for the Greek
      pantheon. Often the attempt is made by the most learned and
      philosophically-minded among the priests, and results in a
      quasi-philosophical mythology like that of the Brahmans. In the
      monotheistic or half-monotheistic religions, this becomes theology. In
      proportion as it grows more and more laboured and definite the attention
      of the learned and the priestly class is more and more directed to dogma,
      creed, faith, abstract formulae of philosophical or intellectual belief,
      while insisting also upon ritual or practice. But the popular religion
      remains usually, as in India, a religion of practical custom and
      observances alone, having very little relation to the highly abstract
      theological ideas of the learned or the priestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, in the highest religions, a large element of ethics, of sentiment,
      of broad humanitarianism of adventitious emotion, is allowed to come in,
      often to the extent of obscuring the original factors of practice and
      observance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <span class="pagenum">040</span><a name="link040" id="link040"></a>constantly
      taught that &ldquo;real religion&rdquo; means many things which have
      nothing on earth to do with religion proper, in any sense, but are merely
      high morality, tinctured by emotional devotion towards a spiritual being
      or set of beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to all these causes, modern investigators, in searching for the
      origin of religion, are apt to mix up with it, even when dealing with
      savage tribes, many extraneous questions of cosmology, cosmogony,
      philosophy, metaphysics, ethics, and mythology. They do not sufficiently
      see that the true question narrows itself down at last to two prime
      factors&mdash;worship and sacrifice. In all early religions, the practice
      is at a maximum, and the creed at a minimum. We, nowadays, look back upon
      these early cults, which were cults and little else, with minds warped by
      modern theological prejudices&mdash;by constant wrangling over dogmas,
      clauses, definitions, and formularies. We talk glibly of the Hindu faith
      or the Chinese belief, when we ought rather to talk of the Hindu practice
      or the Chinese observances. By thus wrongly conceiving the nature of
      religion, we go astray as to its origin. We shall only get right again
      when we learn to separate mythology entirely from religion, and when we
      recognise that the growth and development of the myth have nothing at all
      to do with the beginnings of worship. The science of comparative mythology
      and folk-lore is a valuable and light-bearing study in its own way: but it
      has no more to do with the origin of religion than the science of ethics
      or the science of geology. There are ethical rules in most advanced cults:
      there are geological surmises in most sacred books: but neither one nor
      the other is on that account religion, any more than the history of
      Jehoshaphat or the legend of Samson.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I want to suggest in the present chapter sums itself up in a few
      sentences thus: Religion is practice, mythology is story-telling. Every
      religion has myths that accompany it: but the myths do not give rise to
      the religion: <span class="pagenum">041</span><a name="link041"
      id="link041"></a>on the contrary, the religion gives rise to the myths.
      And I shall attempt in this book to account for the origin of religion
      alone, omitting altogether both mythology as a whole, and all mythical
      persons or beings other than gods in the sense here illustrated.

      CHAPTER III.&mdash;THE LIFE OF THE DEAD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he <span
      class="pagenum">042</span><a name="link042" id="link042"></a>object of
      this book, we saw at the beginning, is to trace the evolution of the idea
      of God. But the solution of that problem implies two separate questions&mdash;first,
      how did men begin to frame the idea of a god at all; and second, how did
      they progress from the conception of many distinct gods to the conception
      of a single supreme God, like the central deity of Christianity and of
      Islam. In other words, we have first to enquire into the origin of
      polytheism, and next into its gradual supersession by monotheism. Those
      are the main lines of enquiry I propose to follow out in the present
      volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religion, however, has one element within it still older, more
      fundamental, and more persistent than any mere belief in a god or gods&mdash;nay,
      even than the custom or practice of supplicating and appeasing ghosts or
      gods by gifts and observances. That element is the conception of the Life
      of the Dead. On the primitive belief in such life, all religion ultimately
      bases itself. The belief is in fact the earliest thing to appear in
      religion, for there are savage tribes who have nothing worth calling gods,
      but have still a religion or cult of their dead relatives. It is also the
      latest thing to survive in religion; for many modern spiritualists, who
      have ceased to be theists, or to accept any other form of the
      supernatural, nevertheless go on believing in the continued existence of
      the dead, and in the possibility of intercommunication between them and
      the living. This, therefore, which is the earliest manifestation of
      religious thought, <span class="pagenum">043</span><a name="link043"
      id="link043"></a>and which persists throughout as one of its most salient
      and irrepressible features, must engage our attention for a little time
      before we pass on to the genesis of polytheism.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the belief in continued life itself, like all other human ideas, has
      naturally undergone various stages of evolution. The stages glide
      imperceptibly into one another, of course; but I think we can on the whole
      distinguish with tolerable accuracy between three main layers or strata of
      opinion with regard to the continued existence of the dead. In the first
      or lowest stratum, the difference between life and death themselves is but
      ill or inadequately perceived; the dead are thought of as yet bodily
      living. In the second stratum, death is recognised as a physical fact, but
      is regarded as only temporary; at this stage, men look forward to the
      Resurrection of the Body, and expect the Life of the World to Come. In the
      third stratum, the soul is regarded as a distinct entity from the body; it
      survives it in a separate and somewhat shadowy form: so that the opinion
      as to the future proper to this stage is not a belief in the Resurrection
      of the Body, but a belief in the Immortality of the Soul. These two
      concepts have often been confounded together by loose and
      semi-philosophical Christian thinkers; but in their essence they are
      wholly distinct and irreconcilable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall examine each of these three strata separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      And first as to that early savage level of thought where the ideas of life
      and death are very ill demarcated. To us at the present day it seems a
      curious notion that people should not possess the conception of death as a
      necessary event in every individual human history. But that is because we
      cannot easily unread all our previous thinking, cannot throw ourselves
      frankly back into the state of the savage. We are accustomed to living in
      large and populous communities, where deaths are frequent, and where
      natural death in particular is an every-day occurrence. We have behind us
      a vast and long history of previous ages; and <span class="pagenum">044</span><a
      name="link044" id="link044"></a>we know that historical time was occupied
      by the lives of many successive generations, all of which are now dead,
      and none of which on the average exceeded a certain fixed limit of seventy
      or eighty odd years. To us, the conception of human life as a relatively
      short period, bounded by a known duration, and naturally terminating at a
      relatively fixed end, is a common and familiar one.
    </p>
    <p>
      We forget, however, that to the savage all this is quite otherwise. He
      lives in a small and scattered community, where deaths are rare, and where
      natural death in particular is comparatively infrequent. Most of his
      people are killed in war, or devoured by wild beasts, or destroyed by
      accidents in the chase, or by thirst or starvation. Some are drowned in
      rapid rivers; some crushed by falling trees or stones; some poisoned by
      deadly fruits, or bitten by venomous snakes; some massacred by chiefs, or
      murdered in quarrels with their own tribesmen. In a large majority of
      instances, there is some open and obvious cause of death; and this cause
      is generally due either to the hand of man or to some other animal; or
      failing that, to some apparently active effort of external nature, such as
      flood, or lightning, or forest fires, or landslip and earthquake. Death by
      disease is comparatively rare; death by natural decay almost unknown or
      unrecognised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor has the savage a great historic past behind him. He knows few but his
      tribesmen, and little of their ancestors save those whom his parents can
      remember before them. His perspective of the past is extremely limited.
      Nothing enables him to form that wide idea of the necessity and
      invariability of death which to us is so familiar. That &ldquo;all men are
      mortal&rdquo; is to civilised man a truism; to very early savages it would
      necessarily have seemed a startling paradox. No man ever dies within his
      own experience; ever since he can remember, he has continued to exist as a
      permanent part of all his adventures. Most of the savage&rsquo;s family
      have gone on continuously living with him. A death has been a rare and
      startling occurrence. <span class="pagenum">045</span><a name="link045"
      id="link045"></a>Thus the notion of death as an inevitable end never
      arises at all; the notion of death as due to natural causes seems quite
      untenable. When a savage dies, the first question that arises is &ldquo;Who
      has killed him?&rdquo; If he is slain in war, or devoured by a tiger, or
      ripped up by an elephant, or drowned by a stream in spate, or murdered by
      a tribesman, the cause is obvious. If none of these, then the death is
      usually set down to witchcraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the mere fact of death is much less certain among primitive
      or savage men than in civilised communities. We know as a rule with almost
      absolute certainty whether at a given moment a sick or wounded man is dead
      or living. Nevertheless, even among ourselves, cases of doubt not
      infrequently occur. At times we hesitate whether a man or woman is dead or
      has fainted. If the heart continues to beat, we consider them still
      living; if not the slightest flutter of the pulse can be perceived, we
      consider them dead. Even our advanced medical science, however, is often
      perplexed in very obscure cases of catalepsy; and mistakes have occurred
      from time to time, resulting in occasional premature burials. The
      discrimination of true from apparent death is not always easy. Vesalius,
      the eminent anatomist, opened a supposed corpse in which the heart was
      seen to be still beating; and the Abbé Prévost, who had been struck by
      apoplexy, was regarded as dead, but recovered consciousness once more
      under the surgeon&rsquo;s scalpel. Naturally, among savages, such cases of
      doubt are far more likely to occur than among civilised people; or rather,
      to put it as the savage would think of it, there is often no knowing when
      a person who is lying stiff and lifeless may happen to get up again and
      resume his usual activity. The savage is accustomed to seeing his fellows
      stunned or rendered unconscious by blows, wounds, and other accidents,
      inflicted either by the enemy, by wild beasts, by natural agencies, or by
      the wrath of his tribesmen; and he never knows how soon the effect of such
      accidents may pass away, and the man may recover his <span class="pagenum">046</span><a
      name="link046" id="link046"></a>ordinary vitality. As a rule, he keeps and
      tends the bodies of his friends as long as any chance remains of their
      ultimate recovery, and often (as we shall see in the sequel) much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in order to understand this attitude of early man towards his
      wounded, his stricken, and his dead, we must glance aside for a moment at
      the primitive psychology. Very early indeed in the history of the human
      mind, I believe, some vague adumbration of the notion of a soul began to
      pervade humanity. We now know that consciousness is a function of the
      brain; that it is intermitted during sleep, when the brain rests, and also
      during times of grave derangement of the nervous or circulatory systems,
      as when we faint or assume the comatose condition, or are stunned by a
      blow, or fall into catalepsy or epilepsy. We also know that consciousness
      ceases altogether at death, when the brain no longer functions; and that
      the possibility of its further continuance is absolutely cut off by the
      fact of decomposition. But these truths, still imperfectly understood or
      rashly rejected by many among ourselves, were wholly unknown to early men.
      They had to frame for themselves as best they could some vague working
      hypothesis of the human mind, from data which suggested themselves in the
      ordinary course of life; and the hypothesis which they framed was more or
      less roughly that of the soul or spirit, still implicitly accepted by a
      large majority of the human species.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to this hypothesis every man consists of two halves or parts,
      one material or bodily, the other immaterial or spiritual. The first half,
      called the body, is visible and tangible; the second half, called the
      soul, dwells within it, and is more or less invisible or shadowy. It is to
      a large extent identified with the breath; and like the breath it is often
      believed to quit the body at death, and even to go off in a free form and
      live its own life elsewhere. As this supposed independence of the soul
      from the body lies at the very basis of all ghosts and gods, and therefore
      of <span class="pagenum">047</span><a name="link047" id="link047"></a>religion
      itself, I may be excused for going at some length into the question of its
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, so far as we know by direct and trustworthy evidence, the
      existence of a mind, consciousness, or &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; apart from a
      body, has never yet been satisfactorily demonstrated. But the savage
      derived the belief, apparently, from a large number of concurrent hints
      and suggestions, of which such a hypothesis seemed to him the inevitable
      result. During the daytime he was awake; at night he slept; yet even in
      his sleep, while his body lay curled on the ground beside the camp-fire,
      he seemed to hunt or to fight, to make love or to feast, in some other
      region. What was this part of him that wandered from the body in dreams?&mdash;what,
      if not the soul or breath which he naturally regarded as something
      distinct and separate? And when a man died, did not the soul or breath go
      from him? When he was badly wounded, did it not disappear for a time, and
      then return again? In fainting fits, in catalepsy, and in other abnormal
      states, did it not leave the body, or even play strange tricks with it? I
      need not pursue this line of thought, already fully worked out by Mr.
      Herbert Spencer and Dr. Tylor. It is enough to say that from a very early
      date, primitive man began to regard the soul or life as something bound up
      with the breath, something which could go away from the body at will and
      return to it again, something separable and distinct, yet essential to the
      person, very vaguely conceived as immaterial or shadowy, but more so at a

     * The question of the Separate Soul has recently received
     very full treatment from Mr. Frazer in The Golden Bough, and
     Mr. Sidney Hartland in The Legend of Perseus.
</pre>
    <p>
      Moreover, these souls or spirits (which quitted the body in sleep or
      trance) outlived death, and appeared again to survivors. In dreams, we
      often see the shapes of living men; but we also see with peculiar
      vividness the images of the departed. Everybody is familiar with the
      frequent reappearance <span class="pagenum">048</span><a name="link048"
      id="link048"></a>in sleep of intimate friends or relations lately
      deceased. These appearances, I fancy, are especially frequent during the
      first few months of bereavement, and gradually weaken in frequency and
      vividness as time goes on. The reason for both sets of phenomena I take to
      be this: the nervous structures, accustomed to be stimulated in particular
      combinations by intercourse with the dead friend, miss automatically their
      wonted stimulation; and being therefore in a highly nourished and unstable
      state, are peculiarly ready to undergo ideal stimulation in sleep, as we
      know to be the case with other well-nurtured and underworked
      nerve-centres. Or, to put it less materially, the brain falls readily into
      a familiar rhythm. But in course of time the channels atrophy by disuse;
      the habit is lost; and the dream-appearances of the dead friend grow more
      and more infrequent. The savage, however, accepts the dream-world as
      almost equally real with the world of sense-presentation. As he envisages
      the matter to himself, his soul has been away on its travels without its
      body, and there has met and conversed with the souls of dead friends or
      relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must remember also that in savage life occasions for trance, for
      fainting, and for other abnormal or comatose nervous conditions occur far
      more frequently than in civilised life. The savage is often wounded and
      fails from loss of blood; he cuts his foot against a stone, or is half
      killed by a wild beast; he fasts long and often, perforce, or is reduced
      to the very verge of starvation; and he is therefore familiar, both in his
      own case and in the case of others, with every variety of unconsciousness
      and of delirium or delusion. All these facts figure themselves to his mind
      as absences of the soul from the body, which is thus to him a familiar and
      almost every-day experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, it will hence result that the savage can hardly gain any clear
      conception of Death, and especially of death from natural causes. When a
      tribesman is brought home severely wounded and unconscious, the spectator&rsquo;s
      immediate <span class="pagenum">049</span><a name="link049" id="link049"></a>idea
      must necessarily be that the soul has gone away and deserted the body. For
      how long it has gone, he cannot tell; but his first attempts are directed
      towards inducing or compelling it to return again. For this purpose, he
      often addresses it with prayers and adjurations, or begs it to come back
      with loud cries and persuasions. And he cannot possibly discriminate
      between its temporary absence and its final departure. As Mr. Herbert
      Spencer well says, the consequences of blows or wounds merge into death by
      imperceptible stages. &ldquo;Now the injured man shortly &lsquo;returned
      to himself,&rsquo; and did not go away again; and now, returning to
      himself only after a long absence, he presently deserted his body for an
      indefinite time. Lastly, instead of these temporary returns, followed by
      final absence, there sometimes occurred cases in which a violent blow
      caused continuous absence from the very first; the other self never came
      back at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact, during these earlier stages, the idea of Death as we
      know it did not and does not occur in any form. There are still savages
      who do not seem to recognise the universality and necessity of death&mdash;who
      regard it on the contrary as something strange and unatural, something due
      to the machination of enemies or of witchcraft. With the earliest men, it
      is a foregone conclusion, psychologically speaking, that they should so
      regard it; they could not form any other concept without far more extended
      knowledge than they have the means of possessing. To them, a Dead Man must
      always have seemed a man whose soul or breath or other self had left him,
      but might possibly return again to the body at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the three stages of thought above discriminated has its
      appropriate mode of disposing of its dead. The appropriate mode for this
      earliest stage is Preservation of the Corpse, which eventuates at last in
      Mummification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest form of this mode of disposal of the corpse consists in
      keeping it in the hut or cave where the family dwell, together with the
      living. A New Guinea woman thus <span class="pagenum">050</span><a
      name="link050" id="link050"></a>kept her husband&rsquo;s body in her hut
      till it dried up of itself, and she kissed it and offered it food every
      day, as though it were living. Many similar cases are reported from
      elsewhere. Hut preservation is common in the very lowest races. More
      frequently, however, owing to the obvious discomfort of living in too
      close proximity to a dead body, the corpse at this stage of thought is
      exposed openly in a tree or on a platform or under some other
      circumstances where no harm can come to it. Among the Australians and
      Andaman Islanders, who, like the Negritoes of New Guinea, preserve for us
      a very early type of human customs, the corpse is often exposed on a rough
      raised scaffold. Some of the Polynesian and Melanesian peoples follow the
      same practice. The Dyaks and Kyans expose their dead in trees. &ldquo;But
      it is in America,&rdquo; says Mr. Herbert Spencer, &ldquo;that exposure on
      raised stages is commonest. The Dakotahs adopt this method; at one time it
      was the practice of the Iroquois; Catlin, describing the Mandans as having
      scaffolds on which &lsquo;their <i>dead live</i> as they term it,&rsquo;
      remarks that they are thus kept out of the way of wolves and dogs; and
      Schoolcraft says the same of the Chippewas.&rdquo; Generally speaking, at
      the lowest grades of culture, savages preserve the actual bodies of their
      dead above ground, either in the home itself, or in close proximity to it.
      We shall recur later on to this singular practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight variant on this method, peculiar to a very maritime race, is that
      described by Mr. H. O. Forbes among the natives of Timurlaut:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dead body is placed in a portion of a <i>prau</i> fitted to the
      length of the individual, or within strips of <i>gaba-gaba</i>, or stems
      of the sago-palm pinned together. If it is a person of some consequence,
      such as an <i>Orang Kaya</i>, an ornate and decorated <i>prau</i>-shaped
      coffin is specially made. This is then enveloped in calico, and placed
      either on the top of a rock by the margin of the sea at a short distance
      from the village, or on a high pile-platform erected on the shore <span
      class="pagenum">051</span><a name="link051" id="link051"></a>about
      low-tide mark. On the top of the coffin-lid are erected tall flags, and
      the figures of men playing gongs, shooting guns, and gesticulating wildly
      to frighten away evil influences from the sleeper. Sometimes the platform
      is erected on the shore above high-water mark, and near it is stuck in the
      ground a tall bamboo full of palm-wine; and suspended over a bamboo rail
      are bunches of sweet potatoes for the use of the dead man&rsquo;s <i>Nitu</i>.
      When the body is quite decomposed, his son or one of the family disinters
      the skull and deposits it on a little platform in his house, in the gable
      opposite the fireplace, while to ward off evil from himself he carries
      about with him the atlas and axis bones of its neck in his <i>luon</i>, or
      <i>siri</i>-holder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This interesting account is full of implications whose fuller meaning we
      will perceive hereafter. The use of the skull and of the talisman bone
      should especially be noted for their later importance. For skulls are
      fundamental in the history of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cases like these readily pass into the practice of Mummifying, more
      especially in dry or desert climates. Even in so damp a tropical country
      as New Guinea, however, D&rsquo;Albertis found in a shed on the banks of
      the Fly River two mummies, artificially prepared, as he thought, by
      removal of the flesh, the bones alone being preserved with the skin to
      cover them. Here we have evidently a clear conception of death as a
      serious change, of a different character from a mere temporary absence.
      So, too, Mr. Chalmers says of the Koiari people in the same island,
      &ldquo;They treat their dead after this fashion. A fire is kept burning
      day and night at the head and feet for months. The entire skin is removed
      by means of the thumb and forefinger, and the juices plastered all over
      the face and body of the operator (parent, husband, or wife of the
      deceased). The fire gradually desiccates the flesh, so that little more
      than the skeleton is left.&rdquo; But mummification for the most part is
      confined to drier climates, where it is artificially performed <span
      class="pagenum">052</span><a name="link052" id="link052"></a>down to a
      very evolved stage of civilisation, as we know well in Peru and Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word must be said in passing as to the frequent habit of specially
      preserving, and even carrying about the person, the head or hand of a
      deceased relative. This has been already mentioned in the case of
      Timurlaut; and it occurs frequently elsewhere. Thus Mr. Chalmers says of a
      New Guinea baby: &ldquo;It will be covered with two inches of soil, the
      friends watching beside the grave; but eventually the skull and smaller
      bones will be preserved and worn by the mother.&rdquo; Similarly, in the
      Andaman Islands, where we touch perhaps the lowest existing stratum of
      savage feeling, &ldquo;widows may be seen with the skulls of their
      deceased partners suspended round their necks.&rdquo; The special
      preservation of the head, even when the rest of the body is eaten or
      buried, will engage our attention at a later period: heads so preserved
      are usually resorted to as oracles, and are often treated as the home of
      the spirit. Mr. Herbert Spencer has collected many similar instances, such
      as that of the Tasmanians who wore a bone from the skull or arm of a dead
      relation. He rightly notes, too, that throughout the New World &ldquo;the
      primitive conception of death as a long-suspended animation seems to have
      been especially vivid;&rdquo; and we find accordingly that customs of this
      character are particularly frequent among American savages. Thus, to draw
      once more from his great storehouse, the Créés carried bones and hair of
      dead relations about for three years; while the Caribs and several Guiana
      tribes distributed the clean bones among the kinsmen of the deceased. In
      the Sandwich Islands, also, bones of kings and chiefs were carried about
      by their descendants, under the impression that the dead exercised
      guardianship over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this stage of thought, it seems to me, it is the actual corpse that is
      still thought to be alive; the actual corpse that appears in dreams; and
      the actual corpse that is fed and worshipped and propitiated with
      presents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ceremonial <span class="pagenum">053</span><a name="link053" id="link053"></a>cannibalism,
      which will be more fully considered hereafter, appears in this stratum,
      and survives from it into higher levels. The body is eaten entire, and the
      bones preserved; or the flesh and fat are removed, and the skin left; or a
      portion only is sacramentally and reverently eaten by the surviving
      relations. These processes also will be more minutely described in the
      sequel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first stage merges by gradual degrees into the second, which is that
      of Burial or its equivalent. Cave-burial of mummies or of corpses forms
      the transitional link. Indeed, inasmuch as many races of primitive men
      lived habitually in caves, the placing or leaving the corpse in a cave
      seems much the same thing as the placing or leaving it in a shed, hut, or
      shelter. The cave-dwelling Veddahs simply left the dead man in the cave
      where he died, and themselves migrated to some other cavern. Still,
      cave-burial lingered on late with many tribes or nations which had for
      ages outlived the habit of cave-dwelling. Among the South American
      Indians, cave-burial was common; and in Peru it assumed high developments
      of mummification. The making of an artificial cave or vault for the dead
      is but a slight variant on this custom; it was frequent in Egypt, the
      other dry country where the making of mummies was carried to a high pitch
      of perfection. The Tombs of the Kings at Thebes are splendid instances of
      such artificial caves, elaborated into stately palaces with painted walls,
      where the dead monarchs might pass their underground life in state and
      dignity. Cave-tombs, natural or artificial, are also common in Asia Minor,
      Italy, and elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first stage, it may be noted, the attitude of man towards his
      dead is chiefly one of affectionate regard. The corpse is kept at home,
      and fed or tended; the skull is carried about as a beloved object. But in
      the second stage, which induces the practice of burial, a certain Fear of
      the Dead becomes more obviously apparent. Men dread the return of the
      corpse or the ghost, and strive to keep <span class="pagenum">054</span><a
      name="link054" id="link054"></a>it within prescribed limits. In this
      stage, the belief in the Resurrection of the Body is the appropriate
      creed; and though at first the actual corpse is regarded as likely to
      return to plague survivors, that idea gives place a little later, I
      believe, to the conception of a less material double or spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here let us begin by discriminating carefully between the Resurrection
      of the Body and the Immortality of the Soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of Resurrection arose from and is closely bound up with the
      practice of burial, the second and simpler mode of disposing of the
      remains of the dead. The idea of Immortality arose from and is closely
      bound up with the practice of burning, a later and better innovation,
      invented at the third stage of human culture. During the early historical
      period all the most advanced and cultivated nations burnt their dead, and,
      in consequence, accepted the more ideal and refined notion of Immortality.
      But modern European nations bury their dead, and, in consequence, accept,
      nominally at least, the cruder and grosser notion of Resurrection.
      Nominally, I say, because, in spite of creeds and formularies, the
      influence of Plato and other ancient thinkers, as well as of surviving
      ancestral ideas, has made most educated Europeans really believe in
      Immortality, even when they imagine themselves to be believing in
      Resurrection. Nevertheless, the belief in Resurrection is the avowed and
      authoritative belief of the Christian world, which thus proclaims itself
      as on a lower level in this respect than the civilised peoples of
      antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest of these two ways of disposing of the bodies of the dead is
      certainly by burial. As this fact has recently been called in question, I
      will venture to enlarge a little upon the evidence in its favour. In point
      of time, burial goes back with certainty to the neolithic age, and with
      some probability to the palaeolithic. Several true interments in caves
      have been attributed by competent geologists to the earlier of these two
      periods, the first for which we <span class="pagenum">055</span><a
      name="link055" id="link055"></a>have any sure warranty of man&rsquo;s
      existence on earth. But, as I do not desire to introduce controversial
      matter of any sort into this exposition, I will waive the evidence for
      burial in the palaeolithic age as doubtful, and will merely mention that
      in the Mentone caves, according to Mr. Arthur Evans, a most competent
      authority, we have a case of true burial accompanied by neolithic remains
      of a grade of culture earlier and simpler than any known to us elsewhere.
      In other words, from the very earliest beginning of the neolithic age men
      buried their dead; and they continued to bury them, in caves or tumuli,
      down to the end of neolithic culture. They buried them in the Long Barrows
      in England; they buried them in the Ohio mounds; they buried them in the
      shadowy forests of New Zealand; they buried them in the heart of darkest
      Africa. I know of no case of burning or any means of disposal of the dead,
      otherwise than by burial or its earlier equivalent, mummification, among
      people in the stone age of culture in Europe. It is only when bronze and
      other metals are introduced that races advance to the third stage, the
      stage of cremation. In America, however, the Mexicans we*re cremationists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wide diffusal of burial over the globe is also a strong argument for
      its relatively primitive origin. In all parts of the world men now bury
      their dead, or did once bury them. From the Tombs of the Kings at Pekin to
      the Pyramids of Memphis; from the Peruvian caves to the Samoyed
      graveyards, we find most early peoples, most savage peoples, most
      primitive peoples, once or still engaged in one or other form of burying.
      Burial is the common and universal mode; burning, exposure, throwing into
      a sacred river, and so forth, are sporadic and exceptional, and in many
      cases, as among the Hindus, are demonstrably of late origin, and connected
      with certain relatively modern refinements of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, in many or most cases, we have positive evidence that where a
      race now burns its dead, it used once <span class="pagenum">056</span><a
      name="link056" id="link056"></a>to bury them. Burial preceded burning in
      preheroic Greece, as it also did in Etruria and in early Latium. The
      people of the Long Barrows, in Western Europe generally, buried their
      dead; the people of the Round Barrows who succeeded them, and who
      possessed a far higher grade of culture, almost always cremated. It has
      been assumed that burning is primordial in India; but Mr. William Simpson,
      the well-known artist of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, calls my
      attention to the fact that the Vedas speak with great clearness of burial
      as the usual mode of disposing of the corpse, and even allude to the
      tumulus, the circle of stones around it, and the sacred <i>temenos</i>
      which they enclose. According to Rajendralala Mitra, whose high authority
      on the subject is universally acknowledged, burial was the rule in India
      till about the thirteenth or fourteenth century before the Christian era;
      then came in cremation, with burial of the ashes, and this continued till
      about the time of Christ, when burial was dispensed with, and the ashes
      were thrown into some sacred river. I think, therefore, until some more
      positive evidence is adduced on the other side, we may rest content with
      our general conclusion that burial is the oldest, most universal, and most
      savage mode of disposing of the remains of the dead among humanity after
      the general recognition of death as a positive condition. It probably took
      its rise in an early period, while mankind was still one homogeneous
      species; and it has been dispersed, accordingly, over the whole world,
      even to the most remote oceanic islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the origin of this barbaric and disgusting custom, so repugnant to
      all the more delicate sentiments of human nature? I think Mr. Frazer is
      right in attributing it to the terror felt by the living for the ghosts
      (or, rather, at first the corpses) of the dead, and the fear that they may
      return to plague or alarm their surviving fellow tribesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his admirable paper on &ldquo;Certain Burial Customs as Illustrative of
      the Primitive Theory of the Soul,&rdquo; Mr. Frazer points out that
      certain tribes of early men paid great <span class="pagenum">057</span><a
      name="link057" id="link057"></a>attention to the dead, not so much from
      affection as from selfish terror. Ghosts or bodies of the dead haunt the
      earth everywhere, unless artificially confined to bounds, and make
      themselves exceedingly disagreeable to their surviving relatives. To
      prevent this, simple primitive philosophy in its second stage has hit upon
      many devices. The most universal is to bury the dead&mdash;that is to say,
      to put them in a deep-dug hole, and to cover them with a mighty mound of
      earth, which has now sadly degenerated in civilised countries into a mere
      formal heap, but which had originally the size and dignity of a tumulus.
      The object of piling up this great heap of earth was to confine the ghost
      (or corpse), who could not easily move so large a superincumbent mass of
      matter. In point of fact, men buried their dead in order to get well rid
      of them, and to effectually prevent their return to light to disturb the
      survivors.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the same reason heavy stones were often piled on the top of the dead.
      In one form, these became at last the cairn; and, as the ghosts of
      murderers and their victims tend to be especially restless, everybody who
      passes their graves in Arabia, Germany, and Spain is bound to add a stone
      to the growing pile in order to confine them. In another form, that of the
      single big stone rolled just on top of the body to keep it down by its
      mass, the makeweight has developed into the modern tombstone. In our own
      times, indeed, the tombstone has grown into a mere posthumous politeness,
      and is generally made to do duty as a record of the name and incomparable
      virtues of the deceased (concerning whom, <i>nil nisi bonum</i>); but in
      origin it was nothing more than the big, heavy boulder, meant to confine
      the ghost, and was anything but honorific in intention and function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, certain nations go further still in their endeavours to keep the
      ghost (or corpse) from roaming. The corpse of a Damara, says Galton,
      having been sewn up in an old ox-hide is buried in a hole, and the
      spectators jump backwards <span class="pagenum">058</span><a name="link058"
      id="link058"></a>and forwards over the grave to keep the deceased from
      rising out of it. In America, the Tupis tied fast all the limbs of the
      corpse, &ldquo;that the dead man might not be able to get up, and infest
      his friends with his visits.&rdquo; You may even divert a river from its
      course, as Mr. Frazer notes, bury your dead man securely in its bed, and
      then allow the stream to return to its channel. It was thus that Alaric
      was kept in his grave from further plaguing humanity; and thus Captain
      Cameron found a tribe of Central Africans compelled their deceased chiefs
      to &ldquo;cease from troubling.&rdquo; Sometimes, again, the grave is
      enclosed by a fence too high for the dead man to clear even with a running
      jump; and sometimes the survivors take the prudent precaution of nailing
      the body securely to the coffin, or of breaking their friend&rsquo;s
      spine, or even&mdash;but this is an extreme case&mdash;of hacking him to
      pieces. In Christian England the poor wretch whom misery had driven to
      suicide was prevented from roaming about to the discomfort of the lieges
      by being buried with a stake driven barbarously through him. The
      Australians, in like manner, used to cut off the thumb of a slain enemy
      that he might be unable to draw the bow; and the Greeks were wont to hack
      off the extremities of their victims in order to incapacitate them for
      further fighting. These cases will be seen to be very luminiferous when we
      come to examine the origin and meaning of cremation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burial, then, I take it, is simply by origin a means adopted by the living
      to protect themselves against the vagrant tendencies of the actual dead.
      For some occult reason, the vast majority of men in all ages have been
      foolishly afraid of meeting with the spirits of the departed. Their great
      desire has been, not to see, but to avoid seeing these singular visitants;
      and for that purpose they invented, first of all, burial, and afterwards
      cremation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The common modern conception of the ghost is certainly that of an
      immaterial or shadowy form, which can be seen but not touched, and which
      preserves an outer semblance <span class="pagenum">059</span><a
      name="link059" id="link059"></a>of the human figure. But that idea itself,
      which has been imported into all our descriptions and reasonings about the
      ghost-beliefs of primitive man, is, I incline to think, very far from
      primitive, and has been largely influenced by quite late conceptions
      derived from the cremational rather than the burial level of religious
      philosophy. In other words, though, in accordance with universal usage and
      Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s precedent, I have used the word &ldquo;ghost&rdquo;
      above in referring to these superstitious terrors of early man, I believe
      it is far less the spirit than the actual corpse itself that early men
      even in this second stage were really afraid of. It is the corpse that may
      come back and do harm to survivors. It is the corpse that must be kept
      down by physical means, that must be covered with earth, pressed flat
      beneath a big and ponderous stone, deprived of its thumbs, its hands, its
      eyes, its members. True, I believe the savage also thinks of the ghost or
      double as returning to earth; but his psychology, I fancy, is not so
      definite as to distinguish very accurately between corpse and spirit. The
      accurate differentiation of the two belongs rather, it seems to me, to the
      post-cremational and more spiritual philosophy than to the primary or
      preservative, and the secondary or inhumational.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anybody who looks at the evidence collected by Mr. Frazer will see for
      himself that precautions are taken rather against the return of the actual
      physical body than against the return of the ghost or spirit. Or perhaps,
      to be more precise, the two are hardly thought of at this early stage in
      separation or antithesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we look at the means taken to preserve the body after death among the
      majority of primitive peoples, above the Tasmanian level, this truth of
      the corpse being itself immortal becomes clearer and clearer. We are
      still, in fact, at a level where ghost and dead man are insufficiently
      differentiated. In all these cases it is believed that the dead body
      continues to live in the grave the same sort of life that it led above
      ground; and for this purpose it is provided <span class="pagenum">060</span><a
      name="link060" id="link060"></a>with weapons, implements, utensils, food,
      vessels, and all the necessaries of life for its new mansion. Continued
      sentient existence of the body after death is the keynote of the earliest
      level of psychical philosophy. First, the corpse lives in the hut with its
      family: later, it lives in the grave with its forefathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But side by side with this naïve belief in the continued existence of the
      body after death, which survives into the inhumational stage of evolution,
      goes another and apparently irreconcilable belief in a future
      resurrection. Strictly speaking, of course, if the body is still alive,
      there is no need for any such special revivification. But religious
      thought, as we all know, does not always pride itself upon the temporal
      virtues of logic or consistency; and the savage in particular is not in
      the least staggered at being asked to conceive of one and the same subject
      in two opposite and contradictory manners. He does not bring the two
      incongruities into thought together; he thinks them alternately, sometimes
      one, sometimes the other. Even Christian systematists are quite accustomed
      to combine the incongruous beliefs in a future resurrection and in the
      continued existence of the soul after death, by supposing that the soul
      remains meanwhile in some nondescript limbo, apart from its body&mdash;some
      uncertain Sheol, some dim hades or purgatory or &ldquo;place of departed
      spirits.&rdquo; The savage is scarcely likely to be more exacting in this
      matter than our doctors of divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the common belief of the second or inhumational stage, then, that
      there will be at some time or other a &ldquo;General Resurrection.&rdquo;
      No doubt this General Resurrection has been slowly developed out of the
      belief in and expectation of many partial resurrections. It is understood
      that each individual corpse will, or may, resurge at some time: therefore
      it is believed that all corpses together will resurge at a single
      particular moment. So long as burial persists, the belief in the
      Resurrection persists beside it, <span class="pagenum">061</span><a
      name="link061" id="link061"></a>and forms a main feature in the current
      conception of the future life among the people who practise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, then, do we progress from this second or inhumational stage to the
      third stage with its practice of burning, and its correlated dogma of the
      Immortality of the Soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, as it seems to me. Besides keeping down the ghost (or corpse)
      with clods and stones, it was usual in many cases to adopt other still
      stronger persuasives and dissuasives in the same direction. Sometimes the
      persuasives were of the gentlest type; for example, the dead man was often
      politely requested and adjured to remain quiet in the grave and to give no
      trouble. But sometimes they were less bland; the corpse was often pelted
      with sticks, stones, and hot coals, in order to show him that his visits
      at home would not in future be appreciated. The ordinary stake and
      mutilation treatment goes, it is clear, upon the same principle; if the
      man has no feet or legs of his own, he cannot very well walk back again.
      But further developments of the like crude idea are to cut off the head,
      to tear out the heart, to hack the body in pieces, to pour boiling water
      and vinegar over the dangerous place where the corpse lies buried. Now
      burning, I take it, belonged originally to the same category of strong
      measures against refractory ghosts or corpses; and this is the more
      probable owing to the fact that it is mentioned by Mr. Frazer among the
      remedies recommended for use in the extreme case of vampires. Its original
      object was, no doubt, to prevent the corpse from returning in any way to
      the homes of the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once any people adopted burning as a regular custom, however, the chances
      are that, <i>coteris paribus</i>, it would continue and spread. For the
      practice of cremation is so much more wholesome and sanitary than the
      practice of burial that it would give a double advantage in the struggle
      for existence to any race that adopted it, in peace and in war. Hence it
      is quite natural that when at a certain grade of culture certain races
      happened to light upon it <span class="pagenum">062</span><a name="link062"
      id="link062"></a>in this superstitious way, those races would be likely to
      thrive and to take the lead in culture as long as no adverse circumstances
      counteracted the advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the superstitions and the false psychology which gave rise at first to
      the notion of a continued life after death would not, of course, disappear
      with the introduction of burning. The primitive cremationists may have
      hoped, by reducing to ashes the bodies of their dead, to prevent the
      recurrence of the corpse to the presence of the living; but they could not
      prevent the recurrence of the ghost in the dreams of the survivors; they
      could not prevent the wind that sighed about the dead man&rsquo;s grave,
      the bats that flitted, the vague noises that terrified, the abiding sense
      of the corpse&rsquo;s presence. All the factors that go to make up the
      ghost or the revenant (to use a safe word less liable to
      misinterpretation) still remained as active as ever. Hence, I believe,
      with the introduction of cremation the conception of the ghost merely
      suffered an airy change. He grew more shadowy, more immaterial, more
      light, more spiritual. In one word, he became, strictly speaking, a ghost
      as we now understand the word, not a returning dead man. This conception
      of the ghost as essentially a shade or shadow belongs peculiarly, it seems
      to me, to the cremating peoples. I can answer for it that among negroes,
      for example, the &ldquo;duppy&rdquo; is conceived as quite a material
      object. It is classical literature, the literature of the cremating Greeks
      and Romans, that has familiarised us most with the idea of the ghost as
      shadowy and intangible. Burying races have more solid doubles. When Peter
      escaped from prison in Jerusalem, the assembled brethren were of opinion
      that it must be &ldquo;his angel.&rdquo; The white woman who lived for
      years in a native Australian tribe was always spoken of by her hosts as a
      ghost. In one word, at a low stage of culture the <i>revenant</i> is
      conceived of as material and earthly; at a higher stage, he is conceived
      of as immaterial and shadowy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now <span class="pagenum">063</span><a name="link063" id="link063"></a>when
      people take to burning their dead, it is clear they will no longer be able
      to believe in the Resurrection of the Body. Indeed, if I am right in the
      theory here set forth, it is just in order to prevent the Resurrection of
      the Body at inconvenient moments that they take to burning. To be sure,
      civilised nations, with their developed power of believing in miracles,
      are capable of supposing, not only that the sea will yield up its dead,
      but also that burnt, mangled, or dispersed bodies will be collected from
      all parts to be put together again at the Resurrection. This, however, is
      not the naïve belief of simple and natural men. To them, when you have
      burnt a body you have utterly destroyed it, here and hereafter; and we
      know that mutilation and burning were employed for this very purpose in
      the case of vampires and other corpses whose total suppression was
      desirable. Sepoys were blown from the guns in the Indian mutiny for the
      express reason that, according to the Hindu belief, that method of
      disposing of them destroyed not only the body but the soul as well&mdash;got
      rid of them entirely. The ordinary human idea is that when you burn a body
      you simply annihilate it; and on that very account early Christians
      preferred burial to cremation, because they thought they stood thereby a
      better chance at the Resurrection. It is true they allowed that the divine
      omnipotence could make new bodies for the martyrs who were burnt; but for
      themselves, they seem to have preferred on the average to go on afresh
      with their old familiar ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, therefore, among cremating peoples, the doctrine of the
      Resurrection of the Body tended to go out, and what replaced it was the
      doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul. You may burn the body, but the
      spirit still survives; and the survival gives origin to a new philosophy
      of ghosts and <i>revenants</i>, a new idea of the inner nature of
      ghosthood. Gradually the spirit gets to be conceived as diviner essence,
      entangled and imprisoned, as it were, in the meshes of the flesh, and only
      to be set free by means <span class="pagenum">064</span><a name="link064"
      id="link064"></a>of fire, which thus becomes envisaged at last as friendly
      rather than destructive in its action on the dead body. What was at first
      a precaution against the return of the corpse becomes in the end a pious
      duty; just as burial itself, originally a selfish precaution against the
      pranks and tricks of returning corpses, becomes in the end so sacred and
      imperative that unburied ghosts are conceived as wandering about,
      Archytas-wise, begging for the favour of a handful of sand to prevent them
      from homeless vagabondage for ever. Nations who burn come to regard the
      act of burning as the appointed means for freeing the ghost from the
      confining meshes of the body, and regard it rather as a solemn duty to the
      dead than as a personal precaution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only so, but there arises among them a vague and fanciful conception
      of the world of shades very different indeed from the definite and
      material conception of the two earlier stages. The mummy was looked upon
      as inhabiting the tomb, which was furnished and decorated for its
      reception like a house; and it was provided with every needful article for
      use and comfort. Even the buried body was supplied with tools and
      implements for the ghost. The necessities of the shade are quite different
      and more shadowy. He has no need of earthly tools or implements. The
      objects found in the Long Barrows of the burying folk and the Round
      Barrows of the cremationists well illustrate this primordial and
      far-reaching difference. The Long Barrows of the Stone Age people are
      piled above an interment; they contain a chambered tomb, which is really
      the subterranean home or palace of the body buried in it. The wives and
      slaves of the deceased were killed and interred with him to keep him
      company in his new life in the grave; and implements, weapons,
      drinking-cups, games, trinkets, and ornaments were buried with their
      owners. The life in the grave was all as material and real as this one;
      the same objects that served the warrior in this world would equally serve
      him in the same form in the next. <span class="pagenum">065</span><a
      name="link065" id="link065"></a>It is quite different with the Round
      Barrows of the Bronze Age cremationists. These barrows are piled round an
      urn., which determines the shape of the tumulus, as the chambered tomb and
      the corpse determine the shape of the earlier Stone Age interments. They
      contain ashes alone; and the implements and weapons placed in them are all
      broken or charred with fire. Why? Because the ghost, immaterial as he has
      now become, can no longer make use of solid earthly weapons or utensils.
      It is only their ghosts or shadows that can be of any use to the ghostly
      possessor in the land of shades. Hence everything he needs is burnt or
      broken, in order that its ghost may be released and liberated; and all
      material objects are now conceived as possessing such ghosts, which can be
      utilised accordingly in the world of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note also that with this advance from the surviving or revivable Corpse to
      the immortal Soul or Spirit, there goes almost naturally and necessarily a
      correlative advance from continued but solitary life in the tomb to a
      freer and wider life in an underground world of shades and spirits. The
      ghost gets greatly liberated and emancipated. He has more freedom of
      movement, and becomes a citizen of an organised community, often envisaged
      as ruled over by a King of the Dead, and as divided into places of reward
      and punishment. But while we modern Europeans pretend to be
      resurrectionists, it is a fact that our current ghostly and eschatological
      conceptions (I speak of the world at large, not of mere scholastic
      theologians) have been largely influenced by ideas derived from this
      opposite doctrine&mdash;a doctrine once held by many or most of our own
      ancestors, and familiarised to us from childhood in classical literature.
      In fact, while most Englishmen of the present day believe they believe in
      the Resurrection of the Body, what they really believe in is the
      Immortality of the Soul..
    </p>
    <p>
      It might seem at first sight as though a grave discrepancy existed between
      the two incongruous ideas, first of burying <span class="pagenum">066</span><a
      name="link066" id="link066"></a>or burning your dead so that they may not
      be able to return or to molest you, and second of worshipping at their
      graves or making offerings to their disembodied spirits. But to the savage
      mind these two conceptions are by no means irreconcilable. While he jumps
      upon the corpse of his friend or his father to keep it in the narrow pit
      he has digged for it, he yet brings it presents of food and drink, or
      slays animals at the tomb, that the ghost may be refreshed by the blood
      that trickles down to it. Indeed, several intermediate customs occur,
      which help us to bridge over the apparent gulf between reverential
      preservation of the mummified body, and the coarse precautions of burial
      or burning. Thus, in many cases, some of which we shall examine in the
      next chapter, after the body has been for some time buried, the head is
      disinterred, and treasured with care in the family oratory, where it is
      worshipped and tended, and where it often gives oracles to the members of
      the household. A ceremonial washing is almost always a feature in this
      reception of the head; it recurs again and again in various cases, down to
      the enshrinement of the head of Hoseyn at Cairo, and that of St. Denis at
      the abbey of the same name, to both of which we shall allude once more at
      a far later stage of our enquiry. For the present, it must suffice to say
      that the ceremonial and oracular preservation of the head&mdash;the part
      which sees, and speaks, and eats, and drinks, and listens&mdash;is a
      common feature in all religious usages; that it gives rise apparently to
      the collections of family skulls which adorn so many savage huts and
      oratories; that it may be answerable ultimately for the Roman busts and
      many other imitative images of the dead, in which the head alone is
      represented; and that when transferred to the sacred human or animal
      victim (himself, as we shall hereafter see, a slain god), it seems to
      account for the human heads hung up by the Dyaks and other savages about
      their houses, as also for the skulls of oxen and other sacred animals
      habitually displayed on the front of places of <span class="pagenum">067</span><a
      name="link067" id="link067"></a>worship, whose last relic is the
      sculptured oxen&rsquo;s heads which fill the metopes in some Greek and
      most Roman temples. Much of this, I admit, will be little comprehensible
      to the reader at the present stage of our argument: but I beg him to bear
      in mind provisionally this oracular and representative value of the head
      or skull from this point forth; he will find, as he proceeds, its meaning
      will become clearer and ever clearer at each successive stage of our
      exposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought also to add that between complete preservation of the corpse and
      the practice of burial there seems to have gone another intermediate
      stage, now comparatively rare, but once very general, if we may judge from
      the traces it has left behind it&mdash;a stage when all the body or part
      of it was sacramentally eaten by the survivors as an act of devotion. We
      will consider this curious and revolting practice more fully when we reach
      the abstruse problem of sacrifice and sacrament; for the present it will
      suffice to say that in many instances, in Australia, South America, and
      elsewhere, the body is eaten, while only the bones are burned or buried.
      Among these savages, again, it usually happens that the head is cleaned of
      its flesh by cooking, while the skull is ceremonially washed, and
      preserved as an object of household veneration and an oracular deity.
      Instances will be quoted in succeeding chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, between the care taken to prevent returns of the corpse, and the
      worship paid to the ghost or shade, primitive races feel no such sense of
      discrepancy or incongruity as would instantly occur to civilised people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three stages in human ideas with which this chapter deals may be
      shortly summed up as corpse-worship, ghost-worship, and shade-worship.

      class="pagenum">068</span><a name="link068" id="link068"></a>Herbert
      Spencer has traced so admirably in his <i>Principles of Sociology</i> the
      progress of development from the Ghost to the God that I do not propose in
      this chapter to attempt much more than a brief recapitulation of his main
      propositions, which, however, I shall supplement with fresh examples, and
      adapt at the same time to the conception of three successive stages in
      human ideas about the Life of the Dead, as set forth in the preceding
      argument. But the hasty <i>resume</i> which I shall give at present will
      be fleshed out incidentally at a later point by consideration of several
      national religions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the earliest stage of all&mdash;the stage where the actual bodies of
      the dead are preserved,&mdash;Gods as such are for the most part unknown:
      it is the corpses of friends and ancestors that are worshipped and
      reverenced. For example, Ellis says of the corpse of a Tahitian chief that
      it was placed in a sitting posture under a protecting shed; &ldquo;a small
      altar was erected before it, and offerings of fruit, food, and flowers
      were daily presented by the relatives, or the priest appointed to attend
      the body.&rdquo; (This point about the priest is of essential importance.)
      The Central Americans, again, as Mr. Spencer notes, performed similar
      rites before bodies dried by artificial heat. The New Guinea people, as D&rsquo;Albertis
      found, worship the dried mummies of their fathers and husbands. A little
      higher in the scale, we get the developed mummy-worship of Egypt and Peru,
      which survives even after the evolution <span class="pagenum">069</span><a
      name="link069" id="link069"></a>of greater gods, from powerful kings or
      chieftains. Other evidence in abundance has been adduced from Polynesia
      and from Africa. Wherever the actual bodies of the dead are preserved,
      there also worship and offerings are paid to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, however, as already noted, it is not the whole body but the head
      alone that is specially kept and worshipped. Thus Mr. H. O. Forbes says of
      the people of Buru: &ldquo;The dead are buried in the forest in some
      secluded spot, marked often by a <i>merang</i> or grave-pole; over which
      at certain intervals the relatives place tobacco, cigarettes, and various
      offerings. When the body is decomposed, the son or nearest relative
      disinters the head, wraps a new cloth about it, and places it in the
      Matakau at the back of his house, or in a little hut erected for it near
      the grave. It is the representative of his forefathers, whose behests he
      holds in the greatest respect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two points are worthy of notice in this interesting account, as giving us
      an anticipatory hint of two further accessories whose evolution we must
      trace hereafter; first the grave-stake, which is probably the origin of
      the wooden idol; and second, the little hut erected over the head by the
      side of the grave, which is undoubtedly one of the origins of the temple
      or praying-house. Observe also the ceremonial wrapping of the skull in
      cloth, and its oracular functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, Mr. Wyatt Gill, the well-known missionary, writes of a dead
      baby at Boera, in New Guinea: &ldquo;It will be covered with two inches of
      soil, the friends watching beside the grave; but eventually the skull and
      smaller bones will be preserved and worn by the mother.&rdquo; And of the
      Suau people he says: &ldquo;Enquiring the use of several small houses, I
      learned that it is to cover grave-pits. All the members of a family at
      death occupy the same grave, the earth that thinly covered the last
      occupant being scooped out to admit the newcomer. These graves are
      shallow; the dead are buried in a sitting posture, hands folded. <span
      class="pagenum">070</span><a name="link070" id="link070"></a>The earth is
      thrown in up to the mouth only. An earthen pot covers the head. After a
      time the pot is taken off, the perfect skull removed and cleansed&mdash;eventually
      to be hung up in a basket or net inside the dwelling of the deceased over
      the fire, to blacken in the smoke.&rdquo; In Africa, again, the skull is
      frequently preserved in such a pot and prayed to. In America, earthenware
      pots have been found moulded round human skulls in mounds at New Madrid
      and elsewhere; the skull cannot be removed without breaking the vessel.
      Indeed, this curious method of preservation in pots seems to be very
      widespread; we get perhaps a vague hint or reminiscence of its former
      prevalence in Europe in the story of Isabella and the pot of basil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The special selection and preservation of the head as an object of worship
      thus noted in New Guinea and the Malay Archipelago is also still found
      among many other primitive peoples. For instance, the Andamanese widows
      keep the skulls of their husbands as a precious possession: and the New
      Caledonians, in case of sickness or calamities, &ldquo;present offerings
      of food to the skulls of the departed.&rdquo; Mr. Spencer quotes several
      similar examples, a few of which alone I extract from his pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In the private fetish-hut of King Adolee, at Badagry, the
      skull of that monarch&rsquo;s father is preserved in a clay vessel placed
      in the earth.&rsquo; He &lsquo;gently rebukes it if his success does not
      happen to answer his expectations.&rsquo; Similarly among the Mandans, who
      place the skulls of their dead in a circle, each wife knows the skull of
      her former husband or child, &lsquo;and there seldom passes a day that she
      does not visit it, with a dish of the best cooked food.... There is
      scarcely an hour in a pleasant day, but more or less of these women may be
      seen sitting or lying by the skull of their child or husband&mdash;talking
      to it in the most pleasant and endearing language that they can use (as
      they were wont to do in former days), and seemingly getting an answer
      back.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This <span class="pagenum">071</span><a name="link071" id="link071"></a>affectionate
      type of converse with the dead, almost free from fear, is especially
      characteristic of the first or corpse-preserving stage of human
      death-conceptions. It seldom survives where burial has made the feeling
      toward the corpse a painful or loathsome one, and it is then confined to
      the head alone, while the grave itself with the body it encloses is rather
      shunned and dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little above this level, Mr. Du Chaillu notes that some of his West
      African followers, when going on an expedition, brought out the skulls of
      their ancestors (which they religiously preserved) and scraped off small
      portions of the bone, which they mixed with water and drank; giving as a
      reason for this conduct that their ancestors were brave, and that by
      drinking a portion of them they too became brave and fearless like their
      ancestors. Here we have a simple and early case of that habit of &ldquo;eating
      the god&rdquo; to whose universality and importance Mr. Frazer has so
      forcibly called attention, and which we must examine at full in a
      subsequent chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the earlier and ruder phases of human evolution, this primitive
      conception of ancestors or dead relatives as the chief known objects of
      worship survives undiluted: and ancestor-worship remains to this day the
      principal religion of the Chinese, and of several other peoples. Gods, as
      such, are practically unknown in China. Ancestor-worship also survives in
      many other races as one of the main cults, even after other elements of
      later religion have been superimposed upon it. In Greece and Rome, it
      remained to the last an important part of domestic ritual. But in most
      cases, a gradual differentiation is set up in time between various classes
      of ghosts or dead persons, some ghosts being considered of more importance
      and power than others; and out of these last it is that gods as a rule are
      finally developed. A god, in fact, is in the beginning at least an
      exceptionally powerful and friendly ghost&mdash;a ghost able to help, and
      from whose help great things may reasonably be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, <span class="pagenum">072</span><a name="link072" id="link072"></a>the
      rise of chieftainship and kingship has much to do with the growth of a
      higher conception of godhead; a dead king of any great power or authority
      is sure to be thought of in time as a god of considerable importance. We
      shall trace out this idea more fully hereafter in the religion of Egypt;
      for the present it must suffice to say that the supposed power of the gods
      in each pantheon has regularly increased in proportion to the increased
      power of kings or emperors.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we pass from the first plane of corpse-preservation and mummification
      to the second plane where burial is habitual, it might seem at a hasty
      glance as though continued worship of the dead, and their elevation into
      gods, would no longer be possible. For we saw that burial is prompted by a
      deadly fear lest the corpse or ghost should return to plague the living.
      Nevertheless, natural affection for parents or friends, and the desire to
      ensure their good will and aid, make these seemingly contrary ideas
      reconcilable. As a matter of fact, we find that even when men bury or burn
      their dead, they continue to worship them: while, as we shall show in the
      sequel, even the great stones which they roll on top of the grave to
      prevent the dead from rising again become in time altars on which
      sacrifices are offered to the spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these two later stages of thought with regard to the dead which
      accompany burial and cremation, the gods, indeed, grow more and more
      distinct from minor ghosts with an accelerated rapidity of evolution. They
      grow greater in proportion to the rise of temples and hierarchies.
      Furthermore, the very indefiniteness of the bodiless ghost tells in favour
      of an enlarged godship. The gods are thought of as more and more aerial
      and immaterial, less definitely human in form and nature; they are clothed
      with mighty attributes; they assume colossal size; they are even
      identified with the sun, the moon, the great powers of nature. But they
      are never quite omnipotent during the polytheistic stage, because in a
      pantheon they are <span class="pagenum">073</span><a name="link073"
      id="link073"></a>necessarily mutually limiting. Even in the Greek and
      Roman civilisation, it is clear that the gods were not commonly envisaged
      by ordinary minds as much more than human; for Pisistratus dressed up a
      courtesan at Athens to represent Pallas Athene, and imposed by this cheap
      theatrical trick upon the vulgar Athenians; while Paul and Barnabas were
      taken at Lystra for Zeus and Hermes. Many similar instances will occur at
      once to the classical scholar. It is only quite late, under the influence
      of monotheism, that the exalted conceptions of deity now prevalent began
      to form themselves in Judaism and Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mere domestic ancestor-worship, once more, could scarcely give us the
      origin of anything more than domestic religion&mdash;the cult of the
      manes, the household gods, as distinct from that of the tribal and
      national deities. But kingship supplies us with the missing link. We have
      seen in Mr. Duff Macdonald&rsquo;s account of the Central African
      god-making how the worship of the chief&rsquo;s ancestors gives rise to
      tribal or village gods; and it is clear how, as chieftainship and kingship
      widen, national gods of far higher types may gradually evolve from these
      early monarchs. Especially must we take the time-element into account,
      remembering that the earlier ancestors get at last to be individually
      forgotten as men, and remain in memory only as supernatural beings. Thus
      kingship rapidly reacts upon godship. If the living king himself is great,
      how much greater must be the ancestor whom even the king himself fears and
      worships; and how infinitely greater still that yet earlier god, the
      ancestor&rsquo;s ancestor, whom the ancestor himself revered and
      propitiated! In some such way there grows up gradually a hierarchy of
      gods, among whom the oldest, and therefore the least known, are usually in
      the end the greatest of any.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consolidation of kingdoms and empires, and the advance of the arts,
      tell strongly with concurrent force in these directions; while the
      invention of written language sets <span class="pagenum">074</span><a
      name="link074" id="link074"></a>a final seal on the godhead and might of
      great early ancestors. Among very primitive tribes, indeed, we find as a
      rule only very domestic and recent objects of worship. The chief prays for
      the most part to his own father and his immediate predecessors. The more
      ancient ancestors, as Mr. Duff Macdonald has so well pointed out, grow
      rapidly into oblivion. But with more advanced races, various agencies
      arise which help to keep in mind the early dead; and in very evolved
      communities these agencies, reaching a high pitch of evolution, make the
      recent gods or kings or ghosts seem comparatively unimportant by the side
      of the very ancient and very long-worshipped ones. More than of any other
      thing, it may be said of a god, <i>vires acquirit eundo</i>. Thus, in
      advanced types of society, saints or gods of recent origin assume but
      secondary or minor importance; while the highest and greatest gods of all
      are those of the remotest antiquity, whose human history is lost from our
      view in the dim mist of ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three such agencies of prime importance in the transition from the mere
      ghost to the fully developed god must here be mentioned. They are the rise
      of temples, of idols, and, above all, of priesthoods. Each of these we
      must now consider briefly but separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of the Temple is various; but all temples may nevertheless be
      reduced in the last resort either into graves of the dead, or into places
      where worship is specially offered up to them. This truth, which Mr.
      Herbert Spencer arrived at by examination of the reports of travellers or
      historians, and worked up in connection with his <i>Principles of
      Sociology</i>, was independently arrived at through quite a different line
      of observation and reasoning by Mr. William Simpson, the well-known artist
      of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>. Mr. Simpson has probably visited a
      larger number of places of worship all over the world than any other
      traveller of any generation: and he was early impressed by the fact which
      forced itself upon his eyes, that almost every one of them, where its
      origin could be <span class="pagenum">075</span><a name="link075"
      id="link075"></a>traced, turned out to be a tomb in one form or another.
      He has set forth the results of his researches in this direction in
      several admirable papers, all of which, but especially the one entitled <i>The
      Worship of Death</i>, I can confidently recommend to the serious attention
      of students of religion. They contain the largest collection of instances
      in this matter ever yet made; and they show beyond a doubt the affiliation
      of the very idea of a temple on the tomb or grave of some distinguished
      dead person, famous for his power, his courage, or his saintliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cave is probably the first form of the Temple. Sometimes the dead man
      is left in the cave which he inhabited when living; an instance of which
      we have already noticed among the Veddahs of Ceylon. In other cases, where
      races have outgrown the custom of cave-dwelling, the habit of cave-burial,
      or rather of laying the dead in caves or in artificial grottoes, still
      continues through the usual conservatism of religious feeling. Offerings
      are made to the dead in all these various caves: and here we get the
      beginnings of cave-temples. Such temples are at first of course either
      natural or extremely rude; but they soon begin to be decorated with rough
      frescoes, as is done, for example, by the South African Bushmen. These
      frescoes again give rise in time by slow degrees to such gorgeous works as
      those of the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes; each of which has attached to
      it a magnificent temple as its mortuary chapel. Sculpture is similarly
      employed on the decoration of cave-temples; and we get the final result of
      such artistic ornament in splendid cave-temples like those of Ellora. Both
      arts were employed together in the beautiful and interesting Etruscan
      tomb-temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another class of cases, the hut where the dead man lived is abandoned
      at his death by his living relations, and thus becomes a rudimentary
      Temple where offerings are made to him. This is the case with the
      Hottentots, to take an instance at a very low grade of culture. Of a New
      Guinea <span class="pagenum">076</span><a name="link076" id="link076"></a>hut-burial,
      Mr. Chalmers says: &ldquo;The chief is buried in the centre; a mat was
      spread over the grave, on which I was asked to sit until they had a
      weeping.&rdquo; This weeping is generally performed by women&mdash;a touch
      which leads us on to Adonis and Osiris rites, and to the Christian Pietà.
      Mr. Spencer has collected several other excellent examples. Thus, the
      Arawaks place the corpse in a small boat and bury it in the hut; among the
      Creeks, the habitation of the dead becomes his place of interment; the
      Fantees likewise bury the dead person in his own house; and the Yucatanese
      &ldquo;as a rule abandoned the house, and left it uninhabited after the
      burial.&rdquo; I will not multiply quotations; it will be better to refer
      the reader to Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s own pages, where a sufficient number of
      confirmatory examples are collected to satisfy any but the most prejudiced
      critic. &ldquo;As repeated supplies of food are taken to the abandoned
      house,&rdquo; says Mr. Spencer, &ldquo;and as along with making offerings
      there go other propitiatory acts, the deserted dwelling house, turned into
      a mortuary house, acquires the attributes of a temple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A third origin for Temples is found in the shed, hut, or shelter, erected
      over the grave, either for the protection of the dead or for the
      convenience of the living who bring their offerings. Thus, in parts of New
      Guinea, according to Mr. Chalmers, &ldquo;The natives bury their dead in
      the front of their dwellings, and cover the grave with a small house, in
      which the near relatives sleep for several months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where house-burial is not practised,&rdquo; says Mr. Spencer, once
      more, &ldquo;the sheltering structure raised above the grave, or above the
      stage bearing the corpse, becomes the germ of the sacred building. By some
      of the New Guinea people there is a &lsquo;roof of atap erected over&rsquo;
      the burial-place. In Cook&rsquo;s time the Tahitians placed the body of a
      dead person upon a kind of bier supported by sticks and under a roof. So,
      too, in Sumatra, where &lsquo;a shed is built over&rsquo; the grave; and
      so, too, in Tonga. Of course <span class="pagenum">077</span><a
      name="link077" id="link077"></a>this shed admits of enlargement and
      finish. The Dyaks in some places build mausoleums like houses, 18 feet
      high, ornamentally carved, containing the goods of the departed&mdash;sword,
      shield, paddle, etc. When we read that the Fijians deposit the bodies of
      their chiefs in small <i>enbures</i> or temples, we may fairly conclude
      that these so-called temples are simply more-developed sheltering
      structures. Still more clearly did the customs of the Peruvians show that
      the structure erected over the dead body develops into a temple. Acosta
      tells us that &lsquo;every one of these kings Yncas left all his treasure
      and revenues to entertaine the place of worshippe where his body was
      layed, and there were many ministers with all their familie dedicated to
      his service.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Note in the last touch, by anticipation, one origin of priesthood. On the
      other hand, we saw in Mr. Duff Macdonald&rsquo;s account of the Central
      African natives that those savages do not worship at the actual grave
      itself. In this case, terror of the <i>revenant</i> seems to prevent the
      usual forms of homage at the tomb of the deceased. Moreover, the ghost
      being now conceived as more or less freely separable from the corpse, it
      will be possible to worship it in some place remote from the dreaded
      cemetery. Hence these Africans &ldquo;seek the spirit at the place where
      their departed kinsman last lived among them. It is the great tree at the
      verandah of the dead man&rsquo;s house that is their temple: and if no
      tree grow here, they erect a little shade, and there perform their simple
      rites.&rdquo; We have in this case yet another possible origin for certain
      temples, and also, I will add by anticipation of a future chapter, for the
      sacred tree, which is so common an object of pious adoration in many
      countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning with such natural caves or such humble huts, the Temple assumes
      larger proportions and more beautiful decorations with the increase of art
      and the growth of kingdoms. Especially, as we see in the tomb-temples and
      pyramids <span class="pagenum">078</span><a name="link078" id="link078"></a>of
      Egypt and Peru, does it assume great size and acquire costly ornaments
      when it is built by a powerful king for himself during his own lifetime.
      Temple-tombs of this description reach a high point of artistic
      development in such a building as the so-called Treasury of Atreus at
      Mycenæ, which is really the sepulchre of some nameless prehistoric
      monarch. It is admirably reconstructed in Perrot and Chipiez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, the importance and magnificence of the temple will react upon
      the popular conception of the importance and magnificence of the god who
      inhabits it. And conversely, as the gods grow greater and greater, more
      art and more constructive skill will constantly be devoted to the building
      and decoration of their permanent homes. Thus in Egypt the tomb was often
      more carefully built and splendidly decorated than the house; because the
      house was inhabited for a short time only, but the tomb for eternity.
      Moreover, as kings grew more powerful, they often adorned the temples of
      their ancestors with emulous pride, to show their own greatness. In Egypt,
      once more, the original part of all the more important temples is but a
      small dark cell, of early origin, to which one successive king after
      another in later dynasties added statelier and ever statelier antechambers
      or porches, so that at last the building assumed the gigantic size and
      noble proportions of Karnak and Luxor. This access of importance to the
      temple cannot have failed to add correspondingly to the dignity of the
      god; so that, as time went on, instead of the early kings being forgotten
      and no longer worshipped, they assumed ever greater and greater importance
      from the magnificence of the works in which their memory was enshrined. To
      the very end, the god depends largely on his house for impressiveness. How
      much did not Hellenic religion itself owe to the Parthenon and the temple
      of Olympian Zeus! How much does not Christianity itself owe to Lincoln and
      Durham, to Amiens and Chartres, to Milan and Pisa, to St. Mark&rsquo;s and
      <span class="pagenum">079</span><a name="link079" id="link070_"></a>St.
      Peter&rsquo;s! Men cannot believe that the deities worshipped in such
      noble and dimly religious shrines were once human like themselves, compact
      of the same bodies, parts, and passions. Yet in the last instance at least
      we know the great works to be raised in honour of a single Lower Syrian
      peasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this brief and imperfect notice of the origin of temples, which will
      indirectly be expanded in later portions of my work, I pass on from the
      consideration of the sacred building itself to that of the Idol who
      usually dwells within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where burial prevails, and where arts are at a low stage of development,
      the memory of the dead is not likely to survive beyond two or three
      generations. But where mummification is the rule, there is no reason why
      deceased persons should not be preserved and worshipped for an indefinite
      period; and we know that in Egypt at least the cult of kings who died in
      the most remote times of the Early Empire was carried on regularly down to
      the days of the Ptolemies. In such a case as this, there is absolutely no
      need for idols to arise; the corpse itself is the chief object of worship.
      We do find accordingly that both in Egypt and in Peru the worship of the
      mummy played a large part in the local religions; though sometimes it
      alternated with the worship of other holy objects, such as the image or
      the sacred stone, which we shall see hereafter to have had a like origin.
      But in many other countries, where bodies were less visibly and obviously
      preserved, the worship due to the ghost or god was often paid to a
      simulacrum or idol; so much so that &ldquo;idolatry&rdquo; has become in
      Christian parlance the common term for most forms of worship other than
      monotheistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what is the origin and meaning of Idols, and how can they be
      affiliated upon primitive corpse or ghost worship?
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the temple, the Idol, I believe, has many separate origins, several
      of which have been noted by Mr. Herbert Spencer, <span class="pagenum">080</span><a
      name="link080" id="link080"></a>while others, it seems to me, have escaped
      the notice even of that profound and acute observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest Idols, if I may be allowed the contradictory expression, are
      not idols at all&mdash;not images or representations of the dead person,
      but actual bodies, preserved and mummified. These pass readily, however,
      into various types of representative figures. For in the first place the
      mummy itself is usually wrapped round in swathing-cloths which obscure its
      features; and in the second place it is frequently enclosed in a wooden
      mummy-case, which is itself most often rudely human in form, and which has
      undoubtedly given rise to certain forms of idols. Thus, the images of
      Amun, Khem, Osiris, and Ptah among Egyptian gods are frequently or
      habitually those of a mummy in a mummy-case. But furthermore, the mummy
      itself is seldom or never the entire man; the intestines at least have
      been removed, or even, as in New Guinea, the entire mass of flesh, leaving
      only the skin and the skeleton. The eyes, again, are often replaced, as in
      Peru, by some other imitative object, so as to keep up the lifelike
      appearance. Cases like these lead on to others, where the image or idol
      gradually supersedes altogether the corpse or mummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. H. O. Forbes gives an interesting instance of such a transitional
      stage in Timorlaut. &ldquo;The bodies of those who die in war or by a
      violent death are buried,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;and if the head has been
      captured [by the enemy], a cocoanut is placed in the grave to represent
      the missing member, and to deceive and satisfy his spirit.&rdquo; There is
      abundant evidence that such makeshift limbs or bodies amply suffice for
      the use of the soul, when the actual corpse has been destroyed or
      mutilated. Sometimes, indeed, the substitution of parts is deliberate and
      intentional. Landa says of the Yucatanese that they cut oft the heads of
      the ancient lords of Cocom when they died, and cleared them from flesh by
      cooking them (very probably to eat at a sacrificial feast, of which more
      hereafter); then they sawed <span class="pagenum">081</span><a
      name="link081" id="link081"></a>off the top of the skull, filled in the
      rest of the head with cement, and, making the face as like as possible to
      the original possessor, kept these images along with the statues and the
      ashes. Note here the usual preservation of the head as exceptionally
      sacred. In other cases, they made for their fathers wooden statues, put in
      the ashes of the burnt body, and attached the skin of the occiput taken
      off the corpse. These images, half mummy, half idol, were kept in the
      oratories of their houses, and were greatly reverenced and assiduously
      cared for. On all the festivals, food and drink were offered to them.
    </p>

      Mr. Spencer has collected other interesting instances of this transitional
      stage between the corpse or mummy and the mere idol. The Mexicans, who
      were cremationists, used to burn a dead lord, and collect the ashes;
      &ldquo;and after kneading them with human blood, they made of them an
      image of the deceased, which was kept in memory of him.&rdquo; Sometimes,
      as in Yucatan, the ashes were placed in a man-shaped receptacle of clay,
      and temples or oratories were erected over them. &ldquo;In yet other
      cases,&rdquo; says Mr. Spencer, &ldquo;there is worship of the relics,
      joined with the representative figure, not by inclusion, but only by
      proximity.&rdquo; Thus Gomara tells us that the Mexicans having burnt the
      body of their deceased king, gathered up the ashes, bones, jewels, and
      gold in cloths, and made a figure dressed as a man, before which, as well
      as before the relics, offerings were placed. It is clear that cremation
      specially lends itself to such substitution of an image for the actual
      dead body. Among burying races it is the severed skull, on the contrary,
      that is oftenest preserved and worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transition from such images to small stone sarcophagi, like those of
      the Etruscan tombs, is by no means a great one. These sarcophagi contained
      the burnt ashes of the dead, but were covered by a lid which usually
      represented the deceased, reclining, as if at a banquet, with a beaker in
      his hands. The tombs in which the sarcophagi were placed were of two
      types; one, the stone pyramid or <span class="pagenum">082</span><a
      name="link082" id="link082"></a>cone, which, says Dr. Isaac Taylor,
      &ldquo;is manifestly a survival of the tumulus&rdquo;; the other, the
      rock-cut chamber, &ldquo;which is a survival of the cave.&rdquo; These
      lordly graves are no mere cheerless sepulchres; they are abodes for the
      dead, constructed on the model of the homes of the living. They contain
      furniture and pottery; and their walls are decorated with costly mural
      paintings. They are also usually provided with an antechamber, where the
      family could assemble at the annual feast to do homage to the spirits of
      departed ancestors, who shared in the meal from their sculptured
      sarcophagus lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a further stage of distance from the primitive mummy-idol we come upon
      the image pure and simple. The Mexicans, for example, as we have seen,
      were cremationists; and when men killed in battle were missing, they made
      wooden figures of them, which they honoured, and then burnt them in place
      of the bodies. In somewhat the same spirit the Egyptians used to place
      beside the mummy itself an image of the dead, to act as a refuge or
      receptacle for the soul, &ldquo;in case of the accidental destruction of
      the actual body.&rdquo; So the Mexicans once more, if one of their
      merchants died on a journey, were accustomed to make a statue of wood in
      the shape of the deceased, to which they paid all the honours they would
      have done to his actual corpse before burning it. In Africa, while a king
      of Congo is being embalmed, a figure is set up in the palace to represent
      him, and is daily furnished with food and drink. Mr. Spencer has collected
      several similar instances of idols substituted for the bodies of the dead.
      The Roman <i>imagines</i> wore masks of wax, which preserved in like
      manner the features of ancestors. Perhaps the most curious modern survival
      of this custom of double representations is to be found in the effigies of
      our kings and queens still preserved in Westminster Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two other sources of idol-worship, however, which, as it seems
      to me, have hardly received sufficient attention at Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s
      hands. Those two are the stake which <span class="pagenum">083</span><a
      name="link083" id="link083"></a>marks the grave, and the standing stone or
      tombstone. By far the larger number of idols, I venture to believe, are
      descended from one or other of these two originals, both of which I shall
      examine hereafter in far greater detail. There is indeed no greater
      lacuna, I fancy, in Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s monumental work than that produced
      by the insufficient consideration of these two fruitful sources of
      worshipful objects. I shall therefore devote a considerable space to their
      consideration in subsequent chapters; for the present it will suffice to
      remark that the wooden stake seems often to form the origin or point of
      departure for the carved wooden image, as well as for such ruder objects
      of reverence as the cones and wooden pillars so widely reverenced among
      the Semitic tribes; while the rough boulder, standing stone, or tombstone
      seems to form the origin or point of departure for the stone or marble
      statue, the commonest type of idol the whole world over in all advanced
      and cultivated communities. Such stones were at first mere rude blocks or
      unhewn masses, the descendants of those which were rolled over the grave
      in primitive times in order to keep down the corpse of the dead man, and
      prevent him from returning to disturb the living. But in time they grew to
      be roughly dressed into slabs or squares, and finally to be decorated with
      a rude representation of a human head and shoulders. From this stage they
      readily progressed to that of the Greek Hermæ. We now know that this was
      the early shape of most Hellenic gods and goddesses; and we can trace
      their evolution onward from this point to the wholly anthropomorphic
      Aphrodite or Here. The well-known figure of the Ephesian Artemis is an
      intermediate case which will occur at once to every classical reader.
      Starting from such shapeless beginnings, we progress at last to the
      artistic and splendid bronze and marble statues of Hellas, Etruria, and
      Rome, to the many-handed deities of modern India, and to the sculptured
      Madonnas and Pietàs of Renaissance Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, <span class="pagenum">084</span><a name="link084" id="link084"></a>as
      the gods grow more beautiful and more artistically finished in
      workmanship, the popular idea of their power and dignity must increase <i>pari
      passu</i>. In Egypt, this increase took chiefly the form of colossal size
      and fine manipulation of hard granitic materials. The so-called Memnon and
      the Sphinx are familiar instances of the first; the Pashts of Syenite, the
      black basalt gods, so well known at the Louvre and the British Museum, are
      examples of the second. In Greece, effect was sought rather by ideal
      beauty, as in the Aphrodites and Apollos, or by costliness of material, as
      in the chryselephantine Zeus and the Athene of the Parthenon. But we must
      always remember that in Hellas itself these glorious gods were developed
      in a comparatively short space of time from the shapeless blocks or
      standing stones of the ruder religion; indeed, we have still many curious
      intermediate forms between the extremely grotesque and hardly human
      Mycenæan types, and the exquisite imaginings of Myron or Phidias. The
      earliest Hellenic idols engraved by Messrs. Perrot and Chipiez in their
      great work on <i>Art in Primitive Greece</i> do not rise in any respect
      superior to the Polynesian level; while the so-called Apollos of later
      archaic workmanship, rigidly erect with their arms at their sides, recall
      in many respects the straight up-and-down outline of the standing stone
      from which they are developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should add that in an immense number of instances the rude stone image
      or idol, and at a still lower grade the unwrought sacred stone, stands as
      the central object under a shed or shelter, which develops by degrees into
      the stately temple. The advance in both is generally more or less
      parallel; though sometimes, as in historical Greece, a temple of the
      noblest architecture encloses as its central and principal object of
      veneration the rough unhewn stone of early barbaric worship. So even in
      Christendom, great churches and cathedrals often hold as their most
      precious possession some rude and antique image like <span class="pagenum">085</span><a
      name="link085" id="link085"></a>the sacred Bambino of Santa Maria in Ara
      Coli at Rome, or the &ldquo;Black Madonnas&rdquo; which are revered by the
      people at so many famous Italian places of pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor do I mean to say that every Idol is necessarily itself a funereal
      relic. When once the idea of godship has been thoroughly developed, and
      when men have grown accustomed to regard an image or idol as the
      representative or dwelling-place of their god, it is easy to multiply such
      images indefinitely. Hundreds of representations may exist of the
      self-same Apollo or Aphrodite or Madonna or St. Sebastian. At the same
      time, it is quite clear that for most worshippers, the divine being is
      more or less actually confused with the image; a particular Artemis or a
      particular Notre Dame is thought of as more powerful or more friendly than
      another. I have known women in Southern Europe go to pray at the shrine of
      a distant Madonna, &ldquo;because she is greater than our own Madonna.&rdquo;
      Moreover, it is probable that in many cases images or sacred stones once
      funereal in origin, and representing particular gods or ghosts, have been
      swallowed up at last by other and more powerful deities, so as to lose in
      the end their primitive distinctness. Thus, there were many Baals and many
      Ashteroths; probably there were many Apollos, many Artemises, many
      Aphrodites. It is almost certain that there were many distinct Hermæ. The
      progress of research tends to make us realise that numberless deities,
      once considered unique and individual, may be resolved into a whole host
      of local gods, afterwards identified with some powerful deity on the
      merest external resemblances of image, name, or attribute. In Egypt at
      least this process of identification and centralisation was common.
      Furthermore, we know that each new religion tends to swallow up and
      assimilate to itself all possible elements of older cults; just as Hebrew
      Jahwehism tried to adopt the sacred stones of early Semitic heathenism by
      associating them with episodes in the history of the patriarchs; and just
      as Christianity has sanctified <span class="pagenum">086</span><a
      name="link086" id="link086"></a>such stones in its own area by using them
      sometimes as the base of a cross, or by consecrating them at others with
      the name of some saint or martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even more than the evolution of the Temple and the Idol, the evolution
      of the Priesthood has given dignity, importance, and power to the gods.
      For the priests are a class whose direct interest it is to make the most
      of the greatness and majesty of the deities they tend or worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priesthood, again, has probably at least two distinct origins. The one is
      quasi-royal; the other is quasiservile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begin with the first. We saw that the chief of an African village, as
      the son and representative of the chief ghosts, who are the tribal gods,
      has alone the right to approach them directly with offerings. The inferior
      villager, who desires to ask anything of the gods, asks through the chief,
      who is a kinsman and friend of the divine spirits, and who therefore
      naturally understands their ideas and habits. Such chiefs are thus also
      naturally priests. They are sacred by family; they and their children
      stand in a special relation to the gods of the tribe, quite different from
      the relation in which the common people stand; they are of the blood of
      the deities. This type of relation is common in many countries; the chiefs
      in such instances are &ldquo;kings and priests, after the order of
      Melchizedek.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To put it briefly, in the earliest or domestic form of religion, the gods
      of each little group or family are its own dead ancestors, and especially
      (while the historic memory is still but weak) its immediate predecessors.
      In this stage, the head of the household naturally discharges the
      functions of priest; it is he who approaches the family ghosts or gods on
      behalf of his wives, his sons, his dependants. To the last, indeed, the
      father of each family retains this priestly function as regards the more
      restricted family rites; he is priest of the worship of the <i>lares</i>
      and <i>penates</i>; he offers the family sacrifice to the family gods; he
      reads family prayers in the Christian household. But as <span
      class="pagenum">087</span><a name="link087" id="link087"></a>the tribe or
      nation arises, and chieftainship grows greater, it is the ghosts or
      ancestors of the chiefly or kingly family who develop most into gods; and
      the living chief and his kin are their natural representatives. Thus, in
      most cases, the priestly office comes to be associated with that of king
      or chief. Indeed, we shall see hereafter in a subsequent chapter that many
      kings, being the descendants of gods, are gods themselves; and that this
      union of the kingly and divine characters has much to do with the growth
      of the dignity of godhead. Here, however, I waive this point for the
      present; it will suffice for us to note at the present stage of our
      argument that in a large number of instances the priesthood and the
      kingship were inherent and hereditary in the self-same families.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The union of a royal title with priestly duties,&rdquo; says Mr.
      Frazer in <i>The Golden Bough</i>, &ldquo;was common in ancient Italy and
      Greece. At Rome and in other Italian cities there was a priest called the
      Sacrificial King or King of the sacred rites (<i>Rex Sacrificulus or Rex
      Sacrorum</i>), and his wife bore the title of Queen of the Sacred Rites.
      In republican Athens, the second magistrate of the state was called the
      King, and his wife the Queen; the functions of both were religious. Many
      other Greek democracies had titular kings, whose duties, so far as they
      are known, seem to have been priestly. At Rome the tradition was that the
      Sacrificial King had been appointed after the expulsion of the kings in
      order to offer the sacrifices which had been previously offered by the
      kings. In Greece a similar view appears to have prevailed as to the origin
      of the priestly kings. In itself the view is not improbable, and it is
      borne out by the example of Sparta, the only purely Greek state which
      retained the kingly form of government in historical times. For in Sparta
      all state sacrifices were offered by the kings as descendants of the god.
      This combination of priestly functions with royal authority is familiar to
      every one. Asia Minor, for example, was the seat of various great
      religious capitals, peopled by thousands of &lsquo;Sacred <span
      class="pagenum">088</span><a name="link088" id="link088_"></a>slaves,&rsquo;
      and ruled by pontiffs who wielded at once temporal and spiritual
      authority, like the popes of mediaeval Rome. Such priest-ridden cities
      were Zela and Pes-sinus. Teutonic Kings, again, in the old heathen days
      seem to have stood in the position and exercised the powers of high
      priests. The Emperors of China offer public sacrifices, the details of
      which are regulated by the ritual books. It is needless, however, to
      multiply examples of what is the rule rather than the exception in the
      early history of the kingship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We will return hereafter in another connexion to this ancient relation of
      kingship with priesthood, which arises naturally from the still more
      ancient relation of the king to the god.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where priesthood originates in this particular way, little differentiation
      is likely to occur between the temporal and the ecclesiastical power. But
      there is a second and far more potent origin of priesthood, less
      distinguished in its beginnings, yet more really pregnant of great results
      in the end. For where the king is a priest, and the descendant of the
      gods, as in Peru and Egypt, his immediate and human power seems to
      overshadow and as it were to belittle the power of his divine ancestors.
      No statue of Osiris, for example, is half so big in size as the colossal
      figure of Rameses II. which lies broken in huge pieces outside the
      mortuary temple of the king it commemorates, among the ruins of Thebes.
      But where a separate and distinct priesthood gets the management of sacred
      rites entirely into its own hands, we find the authority of the gods often
      rising superior to that of the kings, who are only their vicegerents: till
      at last we get Popes dictating to emperors, and powerful monarchs doing
      humble penance before the costly shrines of murdered archbishops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of independent or quasi-servile priesthood is to be found in
      the institution of &ldquo;temple slaves,&rdquo;&mdash;the attendants told
      off as we have already seen to do duty at the grave of the chief or dead
      warrior. Egypt, again affords <span class="pagenum">089</span><a
      name="link089" id="link089"></a>us, on the domestic side, an admirable
      example of the origin of such priesthoods. Over the lintel of each of the
      cave-like tombs at Beni Hassan and Sakkarah is usually placed an
      inscription setting forth the name and titles of its expected occupant
      (for each was built during the life-time of its owner), with an invocation
      praying for him propitious funeral rites, and a good burial-place after a
      long and happy life. Then follows a pious hope that the spirit may enjoy
      for all eternity the proper payment of funereal offerings, a list of which
      is ordinarily appended, together with a statement of the various
      anniversaries on which they were due. But the point which specially
      concerns us here is this: Priests or servants were appointed to see that
      these offerings were duly made; and the tomb was endowed with property for
      the purpose both of keeping up the offerings in question, and of providing
      a stipend or living-wage for the priest. As we shall see hereafter, such
      priesthoods were generally made hereditary, so as to ensure their
      continuance throughout all time: and so successful were they that in many
      cases worship continued to be performed for several hundred years at the
      tomb; so that a person who died under the Early Empire was still being
      made the recipient of funeral dues under kings of the Eighteenth and
      Nineteenth Dynasties.
    </p>
    <p>
      I give this interesting historical instance at some length because it is
      one of the best known, and also one of the most persistent. But
      everywhere, all the world over, similar evolutions have occurred on a
      shorter scale. The temple attendants, endowed for the purpose of
      performing sacred rites for the ghost or god, have grown into priests, who
      knew the habits of the unseen denizen of the shrine. Bit by bit,
      prescriptions have arisen; customs and rituals have developed; and the
      priests have become the depositaries of the divine traditions. They alone
      know how to approach the god; they alone can read the hidden signs of his
      pleasure or displeasure. As intermediaries between worshipper and deity,
      they are themselves half sacred. <span class="pagenum">090</span><a
      name="link090" id="link090"></a>Without them, no votary can rightly
      approach the shrine of his patron. Thus at last they rise into-importance
      far above their origin; priestcraft comes into being; and by magnifying
      their god, the members of the hierarchy magnify at the same time their own
      office and function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet another contributing cause must be briefly noted. Picture-writing and
      hieroglyphics take their rise more especially in connexion with tombs and
      temples. The priests in particular hold as a rule the key to this
      knowledge. In ancient Egypt, to take a well-known instance, they were the
      learned class; they became the learned class again under other
      circumstances in mediaeval Europe. Everywhere we come upon sacred
      mysteries that the priests alone know; and where hieroglyphics exist,
      these mysteries, committed to writing, become the peculiar property of the
      priests in a more special sense. Where writing is further differentiated
      into hieratic and demotic, the gulf between laity and priesthood grows
      still wider; the priests possess a special key to knowledge, denied to the
      commonalty. The recognition of Sacred Books has often the same result; of
      these, the priests are naturally the guardians and exponents. I need
      hardly add that side by side with the increase of architectural grandeur
      in the temple, and the increase of artistic beauty and costliness in the
      idols or statues and pictures of the gods, goes increase in the
      stateliness of the priestly robes, the priestly surroundings, the priestly
      ritual. Finally, we get ceremonies of the most dignified character,
      adorned with all the accessories of painting and sculpture, of candles and
      flowers, of incense and music, of rich mitres and jewelled palls,&mdash;ceremonies
      performed in the dim shade of lofty temples, or mosques, or churches, in
      honour of god or gods of infinite might, power, and majesty, who must yet
      in the last resort be traced back to some historic or prehistoric Dead
      Man, or at least to some sacred stone or stake or image, his relic and
      representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <span class="pagenum">091</span><a name="link091" id="link091"></a>by
      convergence of all these streams, the primitive mummy or ghost or spirit
      passes gradually into a deity of unbounded glory and greatness and
      sanctity. The bodiless soul, released from necessary limits of space and
      time, envisaged as a god, is pictured as ever more and more superhuman,
      till all memory of its origin is entirely forgotten. But to the last,
      observe this curious point: all new gods or saints or divine persons are,
      each as they crop up first, of demonstrably human origin. Whenever we find
      a new god added from known sources to a familiar pantheon, we find without
      exception that he turns out to be&mdash;a human being. Whenever we go back
      to very primitive religions, we find all men&rsquo;s gods are the corpses
      or ghosts of their ancestors. It is only when we take relatively advanced
      races with unknown early histories that we find them worshipping a certain
      number of gods who cannot be easily and immediately resolved into dead men
      or spirits. Unfortunately, students of religion have oftenest paid the
      closest attention to those historical religions which lie furthest away
      from the primitive type, and in which at their first appearance before us
      we come upon the complex idea of godhead already fully developed. Hence
      they are too much inclined, like Professor Robertson Smith, and even
      sometimes Mr. Frazer (whose name, however, I cannot mention in passing
      without the pro-foundest respect), to regard the idea of a godship as
      primordial, not derivative; and to neglect the obvious derivation of
      godhead as a whole from the cult and reverence of the deified ancestor.
      Yet the moment we get away from these advanced and too overlaid historical
      religions to the early conceptions of simple savages, we see at once that
      no gods exist for them save the ancestral corpses or ghosts; that religion
      means the performance of certain rites and offerings to these corpses or
      ghosts; and that higher elemental or departmental deities are wholly
      wanting. Even in the great historical religions themselves, the further
      back we go, and the lower down we <span class="pagenum">092</span><a
      name="link092" id="link092"></a>probe, the closer do we come to the
      foundation-stratum of ghosts or ancestor-gods. And where, as in Egypt, the
      evidence is oldest and most complete throughout, the more do we observe
      how the mystic nature-gods of the later priestly conceptions yield, as we
      go back age by age in time, to the simpler and more purely human ancestral
      gods of the earliest documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be our task in the succeeding chapters of this work to do even
      more than this&mdash;to show that the apparently unresolvable element in
      later religions, including the Hebrew god Jahweh himself, can be similarly
      affiliated by no uncertain evidence upon the primitive conception of a
      ghost or ancestor.

      the last chapter two origins of Idols to which, as I believed, an
      insufficient amount of attention had been directed by Mr. Herbert Spencer.
      These were the Sacred Stone and the Wooden Stake which mark the grave. To
      these two I will now add a third common object of worship, which does not
      indeed enter into the genesis of idols, but which is of very high
      importance in early religion&mdash;the sacred tree, with its collective
      form, the sacred grove. All the objects thus enumerated demand further
      attention at our hands, both from their general significance in the
      history of religion, and also from their special interest in connexion
      with the evolution of the God of Israel, who became in due time the God of
      Christianity and of Islam, as well as the God of modern idealised and
      sublimated theism.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will begin with the consideration of the Sacred Stone, not only because
      it is by far the most important of the three, but also because, as we
      shall shortly see, it stands in the direct line of parentage of the God of
      Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the world over, and at all periods of history, we find among the most
      common objects of human worship certain blocks of stone, either rudely
      shaped and dressed by the hand, or else more often standing alone on the
      soil in all their native and natural roughness. The downs of England are
      everywhere studded with cromlechs, dolmens, and other antique megalithic
      structures (of which the gigantic trilithons of Stonehenge and Avebury are
      the best-known examples), <span class="pagenum">094</span><a name="link094"
      id="link094"></a>long described by antiquaries as &ldquo;druidical
      remains,&rdquo; and certainly regarded by the ancient inhabitants of
      Britain with an immense amount of respect and reverence. In France we have
      the endless avenues of Carnac and Locmariaker; in Sardinia, the curious
      conical shafts known to the local peasants as <i>sepolture dei giganti</i>&mdash;the
      tombs of the giants. In Syria, Major Conder has described similar
      monuments in Heth and Moab, at Gilboa and at Heshbon. In India, five
      stones are set up at the corner of a field, painted red, and worshipped by
      the natives as the Five Pandavas. Theophrastus tells us as one of the
      characteristics of the superstitious man that he anoints with oil the
      sacred stones at the street corners; and from an ancient tradition
      embedded in the Hebrew scriptures we learn how the patriarch Jacob set up
      a stone at Bethel &ldquo;for a pillar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;poured oil upon
      the top of it,&rdquo; as a like act of worship. Even in our own day there
      is a certain English hundred where the old open-air court of the manor is
      inaugurated by the ceremony of breaking a bottle of wine over a standing
      stone which tops a tumulus; and the sovereigns of the United Kingdom are
      still crowned in a chair which encloses under its seat the ancestral
      sacred stone of their heathen Scottish and Irish predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what is the share of such sacred stones in the rise and growth of the
      religious habit?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hardly necessary, I suppose, to give formal proof of the familiar
      fact that an upright slab is one of the commonest modes of marking the
      place where a person is buried. From the ancient pillar that prehistoric
      savages set up over the tumulus of their dead chief, to the headstone that
      marks the dwarfed and stunted barrow in our own English cemeteries, the
      practice of mankind has been one and continuous. Sometimes the stone is a
      rough boulder from the fields; a representative of the big block which
      savages place on the grave to keep the corpse from rising: sometimes it is
      an oblong slab of slate or marble; sometimes, and especially among the
      more advanced races, it is <span class="pagenum">095</span><a
      name="link095" id="link095"></a>a shapely cross or sculptured monument.
      But whenever on earth interment is practised, there stones of some sort,
      solitary or in heaps, almost invariably mark the place of burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, as presents and sacrifices are offered at graves to the spirits of
      the dead, it is at the stone which records the last resting-place of the
      deceased that they will oftenest be presented. As a matter of fact we know
      that, all the world over, offerings of wine, oil, rice, ghee, corn, and
      meat are continually made at the graves of chiefs or relations. Victims,
      both human and otherwise, are sacrificed at the tomb, and their blood is
      constantly smeared on the headstone or boulder that marks the spot.
      Indeed, after a time, the grave and the stone get to be confounded
      together, and the place itself comes to have a certain sacredness, derived
      from the ghost which haunts and inhabits it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four well-marked varieties of early tombstone are recognised in the
      eastern continent at least, and their distribution and nature is thus
      described by Major Conder: &ldquo;Rude stone monuments, bearing a strong
      family resemblance in their mode of construction and dimensions, have been
      found distributed over all parts of Europe and Western Asia, and occur
      also in India. In some cases they are attributable to early Aryan tribes;
      in others they seem to be of Semitic origin. They include <i>menhirs</i>,
      or standing stones, which were erected as memorials, and worshipped as
      deities, with libations of blood, milk, honey, or water poured upon the
      stones: <i>dolmens</i>, or stone tables, free standing&mdash;that is, not
      covered by any mound or superstructure, which may be considered without
      doubt to have been used as altars on which victims (often human) were
      immolated: <i>cairns</i>, also memorial, and sometimes surrounding
      menhirs; these were made by the contributions of numerous visitors or
      pilgrims, each adding a stone as witness of his presence: finally <i>cromlechs</i>,
      or stone circles, used as sacred enclosures or early hypæthral temples,
      often <span class="pagenum">096</span><a name="link096" id="link096"></a>with
      a central menhir or dolmen as statue or altar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be very little doubt that every one of these monuments is
      essentially sepulchral in character. The menhir or standing stone is the
      ordinary gravestone still in use among us: the dolmen is a chambered tomb,
      once covered by a tumulus, but now bare and open: the cairn is a heap of
      stones piled above the dead body: the stone circle is apparently a later
      temple built around a tomb, whose position is marked by the menhir or
      altar-stone in its centre. And each has been the parent of a numerous
      offspring. The menhir gives rise to the obelisk, the stone cross, and the
      statue or idol; the dolmen, to the sarcophagus, the altar-tomb, and the
      high altar; the cairn, to the tope and also to the pyramid; the cromlech,
      or stone circle, to the temple or church in one at least of its many
      developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these classes of monuments, Major Conder observes, has its
      distinctive name in the Semitic languages, and is frequently mentioned in
      the early Hebrew literature. The <i>menhir</i> is the &ldquo;pillar&rdquo;
      of our Authorised Version of the Old Testament; the <i>dolmen</i> is the
      &ldquo;altar&rdquo;; the <i>cairn</i> is the &ldquo;heap&rdquo;; and the
      stone circle appears under the names Gilgal and Hazor. The significance of
      these facts will appear a little later on when I reach a more advanced
      stage in the evolution of stone-worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the simplest and most primitive stage of religion, such as that pure
      ancestor-cult still surviving unmixed among the people of New Guinea or
      the African tribes whose practice Mr. Duff Macdonald has so admirably
      described for us, it is the corpse or ghost itself, not the stone to mark
      its dwelling, which comes in for all the veneration and all the gifts of
      the reverent survivors. But we must remember that every existing religion,
      however primitive in type, is now very ancient; and it is quite natural
      that in many cases the stone should thus come itself to be regarded as the
      ghost or god, the object to which veneration is <span class="pagenum">097</span><a
      name="link097" id="link097"></a>paid by the tribesmen. In fact, just in
      proportion as the ghost evolves into the god, so does the tombstone begin
      to evolve into the fetish or idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, however, it is merely as the rude unshapen stone that the idol
      in this shape receives the worship of its votaries. This is the stage that
      has been christened by that very misleading name fetishism, and
      erroneously supposed to lie at the very basis of all religion. Here are a
      few interesting samples of this stage of stone-worship, taken from the
      very careful Samoan collection of Mr. Turner, of the London Missionary
      Society:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fonge and Toafa were the names of the two oblong smooth stones
      which stood on a raised platform of loose stones inland of one of the
      villages. They were supposed to be the parents of Saato, a god who
      controlled the rain. When the chiefs and people were ready to go off for
      weeks to certain places in the bush for the sport of pigeon-catching,
      offerings of cooked taro and fish were laid on the stones, accompanied by
      prayers for fine weather and no rain. Any one who refused an offering to
      the stones was frowned upon; and in the event of rain was blamed and
      punished for bringing down the wrath of the fine-weather god, and spoiling
      the sports of the season.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, even if one doubts that Saato was a deceased Weather-doctor, and
      that Fonge and Toafa were his father and mother (which I do not care to
      insist upon), it is at least clear that we have to deal essentially with
      two standing stones of precisely the same sort as those which habitually
      mark sepulture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the gods of Hudson&rsquo;s Island, Mr. Turner gives this very
      interesting and suggestive account:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foelangi and Maumau were the principal gods. They had each a
      temple; and under the altars, on which were laid out in rows the skulls of
      departed chiefs and people, were suspended offerings of pearl-shell and
      other valuables. Foelangi had an unchiselled block of stone to represent
      him&mdash;something like a six feet high gravestone.... <span
      class="pagenum">098</span><a name="link098" id="link098"></a>Offerings of
      food were taken to the temples, that the gods might first partake before
      anyone else ate anything.... Husked cocoanuts were laid down, one before
      each skull.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And of St. Augustine Island he writes: &ldquo;At the Temple of Maumau
      there stood a nine feet high coral sandstone slab from the beach.... Meat
      offerings were laid on the altars, accompanied by songs and dances in
      honour of the god.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, about one of the Gilbert Group, Mr. Turner says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had other gods and goddesses, and, as was common in this
      group, had sandstone slabs or pillars set up here and there among the
      houses. Before these shrines offerings of food were laid during the day,
      which the priests took away stealthily by night and made the credulous
      believe that gods and not mortals had done it. If the stone slab
      represented a <i>goddess</i> it was not placed erect, but laid down on the
      ground. Being a <i>lady</i> they thought it would be cruel to make her
      stand so long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In these cases, and in many others, it seems to me clear that the original
      gravestone or menhir itself is the object of worship, viewed as the
      residence of the ghost or god in whose honour it was erected. For in Samoa
      we know that the grave &ldquo;was marked by a little heap of stones, a
      foot or two high,&rdquo; and at De Peyster&rsquo;s Island &ldquo;a stone
      was raised at the head of the grave, and a human head carved on it&rdquo;&mdash;a
      first step, as we have already seen, towards the evolution of one form of
      idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar instances abound everywhere. Among the Khonds of India, every
      village has its local god, represented by an upright stone under the big
      tree on the green, to use frankly an English equivalent. (The full
      importance of this common combination of sacred stone and sacred tree will
      only come out at a later stage of our enquiry.) In Peru, worship was paid
      to standing stones which, says Dr. Tylor, &ldquo;represented the penates
      of households <span class="pagenum">099</span><a name="link099"
      id="link099"></a>and the patron-deities of villages&rdquo;&mdash;in other
      words, the ghosts of ancestors and of tribal chiefs. &ldquo;Near Acora,&rdquo;
      says the Marquis de Nadaillac, &ldquo;the bodies were placed under
      megalithic stones, reminding us of the dolmens and cromlechs of Europe.
      One vast plain is covered with erect stones, some forming circles, some
      squares, and often covered in with large slabs which entirely closed round
      the sepulchral chamber.&rdquo; In Fiji the gods and goddesses &ldquo;had
      their abodes or shrines in black stones like smooth round milestones, and
      there received their offerings of food.&rdquo; An immense number of
      similar instances have been collected by Dr. Tylor and other
      anthropologists.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when once the idea of the sacredness of stones had thus got firmly
      fixed in the savage mind, it was natural enough that other stones,
      resembling those which were already recognised as gods, should come to be
      regarded as themselves divine, or as containing an indwelling ghost or
      deity. Of this stage, Mr. Turner&rsquo;s Samoa again affords us some
      curious instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smooth stones apparently picked up out of the bed of the river were
      regarded as representatives of certain gods, and wherever the stone was,
      there the god was supposed to be. One resembling a fish would be prayed to
      as the fisherman&rsquo;s god. Another, resembling a yam, would be the yam
      god. A third, round like a breadfruit, the breadfruit god&mdash;and so on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the word &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; used by this very cautious observer
      in this passage shows clearly that he had never of his own knowledge seen
      a stone thus selected at random worshipped or deified, and it is therefore
      possible that in all such cases the stone may really have been one of
      sepulchral origin. Still, I agree with Mr. Spencer that when once the idea
      of a ghost or god is well developed, the notion of such a spirit as
      animating any remarkable or odd-looking object is a natural transition. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The whole subject is admirably worked out in The
     Principles of Sociology, § 159.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hence I incline <span class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100"
      id="link100"></a>to believe Mr. Turner is right, and that these stones may
      really have been picked out and worshipped, merely for their oddity, but
      always, as he correctly infers, from the belief in their connexion with
      some god or spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another case, also from Polynesia, where no immediate connexion
      with any particular grave seems definitely implied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two unchiselled &lsquo;smooth stones of the stream&rsquo; were kept
      in a temple at one of the villages, and guarded with great care. No
      stranger or over-curious person was allowed to go near the place, under
      penalty of a beating from the custodians of these gods. They represented
      good and not malicious death-causing gods. The one made the yams,
      breadfruit, and cocoanuts, and the other sent fish to the nets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another stone was carefully housed in another village as the
      representative of a rain-making god. When there was overmuch rain, the
      stone was laid by the fire and kept heated till fine weather set in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Further instances (if fairly reported) occur elsewhere. &ldquo;Among the
      lower races of America,&rdquo; says Dr. Tylor, summarising Schoolcraft,
      &ldquo;the Dakotahs would pick up a round boulder, paint it, and then,
      addressing it as grandfather, make offerings to it, and pray it to deliver
      them from danger.&rdquo; But here the very fact that the stone is
      worshipped and treated as an ancestor shows how derivative is the
      deification&mdash;how dependent upon the prior association of such stones
      with the tomb of a forefather and its indwelling spirit. Just in the same
      way we know there are countries where a grave is more generally marked,
      not by a stone, but by a wooden stake; and in these countries, as for
      instance among the Samoyedes of Siberia, sticks, not stones, are the most
      common objects of reverence. (Thus, again, stick-worship is found &ldquo;among
      the Damaras of South Africa, whose ancestors are represented at the
      sacrificial feasts by stakes cut from trees or bushes consecrated to them,
      to which stakes the meat is first <span class="pagenum">101</span><a
      name="link101" id="link101"></a>offered.&rdquo;) But here, too, we see the
      clear affiliation upon ancestor-worship; and indeed, wherever we find the
      common worship of &ldquo;stocks and stones,&rdquo; all the analogies lead
      us to believe the stocks and stones either actually mark the graves of
      ancestors or else are accepted as their representatives and embodiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast majority, however, of sacred stones with whose history we are
      well acquainted are indubitably connected with interments, ancient or
      modern. All the European sacred stones are cromlechs, dolmens, trilithons,
      or menhirs, of which Mr. Angus Smith, a most cautious authority, observes
      categorically, &ldquo;We know for a certainty that memorials of burials
      are the chief object of the first one, and of nearly all, the only object
      apparently.&rdquo; So many other examples will come out incidentally in
      the course of the sequel that I will not labour the point any further at
      present. Among the most remarkable instances, however, I cannot refrain
      from mentioning the great Sardinian sacred stones, which so often occur in
      the neighbourhood of the <i>nuraghi</i>, or ancient forts. These consist
      of tall conical monoliths, rough and unhewn in the oldest examples, rudely
      hewn in the later ones, and occasionally presenting some distant
      resemblance to a human face&mdash;the first rough draft of the future
      idol. &ldquo;Behind the monolith lies the burial-place, ten to fourteen
      yards long by one or two in width.&rdquo; These burial-places have been
      examined by the Abbate Spano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was satisfied that several bodies had been buried together in
      the same tomb, and that these were therefore family burial-places. When
      the death of one of the members of the tribe occurred, one of the great
      transverse stones which covered the long alley built behind the monolith
      was removed, and then replaced until the time came for another body to
      claim its place in the tomb. The monolith, called by the Sardinian
      peasants <i>pietra dell&rsquo; altare</i>, or altar-stone, because they
      believe it to have been used for human sacrifice, always faces the south
      or east.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such <span class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a>a
      surviving tradition as to the human sacrifices, in an island so little
      sophisticated as Sardinia, has almost certainly come down to us unbroken
      from a very early age.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already stated that the idol is probably in many cases derived from
      the gravestone or other sacred stone. I believe that in an immense number
      of cases it is simply the original pillar, more or less rudely carved into
      the semblance of a human figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      How this comes about we can readily understand if we recollect that by a
      gradual transference of sentiment the stone itself is at last identified
      with the associated spirit. Here, once more, is a transitional instance
      from our Polynesian storehouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great god of Bowditch Island &ldquo;was supposed to be embodied in a
      stone, which was carefully wrapped up with fine mats, and never seen by
      any one but the king&rdquo; (note this characteristic touch of kingly
      priesthood), &ldquo;and that only once a year, when the decayed mats were
      stripped off and thrown away. In sickness, offerings of fine mats were
      taken and rolled round the sacred stone, and thus it got busked up to a
      prodigious size; but as the idol was exposed to the weather out of doors,
      night and day, the mats soon rotted. No one dared to appropriate what had
      been offered to the god, and hence the old mats, as they were taken off,
      were heaped in a place by themselves and allowed to rot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the reasonableness of all this is immediately apparent if we remember
      that the stones which stand on graves are habitually worshipped, and
      anointed with oil, milk, and blood. It is but a slight further step to
      regard the stone, not only as eating and drinking, but also as needing
      warmth and clothing. As an admirable example of the same train of thought,
      working out the same result elsewhere, compare this curious account of a
      stone idol at Inniskea (a rocky islet off the Mayo coast), given by the
      Earl of Roden, as late as 1851, in his <i>Progress of the Reformation in
      Ireland</i>: &ldquo;In <span class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103"
      id="link103"></a>the south island, in the house of a man named Monigan, a
      stone idol, called in the Irish &lsquo;Neevougi,&rsquo; has been from time
      immemorial religiously preserved and worshipped. This god resembles in
      appearance a thick roll of home-spun flannel, which arises from the custom
      of dedicating a dress of that material to it whenever its aid is sought;
      this is sewn on by an old woman, its priestess, whose peculiar care it is.
      Of the early history of this idol no authentic information can be
      procured, but its power is believed to be immense; they pray to it in time
      of sickness; it is invoked when a storm is desired to dash some hapless
      ship upon their coast; and, again, the exercise of its power is solicited
      in calming the angry waves, to admit of fishing or visiting the mainland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is this a solitary instance in modern Europe. &ldquo;In certain
      mountain districts of Norway,&rdquo; says Dr. Tylor, &ldquo;up to the end
      of the last century, the peasants used to preserve round stones, washed
      them every Thursday evening,.... smeared them with butter before the fire,
      laid them in the seat of honour on fresh straw, and at certain times of
      the year steeped them in ale, that they might bring luck and comfort to
      the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first transitional step towards the idol proper is given in some rude
      attempt to make the standing stone at the grave roughly resemble a human
      figure. In the later Sardinian examples, two conical lumps, representing
      the breasts, seem to mark that the figure is intended to be female&mdash;either
      because a woman is buried there, or to place the spot under the protection
      of a goddess. From this rude beginning we get every transitional form,
      like the Hermæ and the archaic Apollos, till we arrive at the perfect
      freedom and beauty of Hellenic sculpture. Says Grote, in speaking of Greek
      worship, &ldquo;their primitive memorial erected to a god did not even
      pretend to be an image, but was often nothing more than a pillar, a board,
      a shapeless stone, or a post [notice the resemblance to ordinary
      grave-marks] receiving care and decoration from the <span class="pagenum">104</span><a
      name="link104" id="link104"></a>neighbourhood as well as worship.&rdquo;
      Dr. Tylor, to whose great collection of instances I owe many
      acknowledgments, says in comment on this passage, &ldquo;Such were the log
      that stood for Artemis in Euboea; the stake that represented Pallas Athene
      &lsquo;sine effigie rudis palus, et informe lignum;&rsquo; the unwrought
      stone at Hyethos, which &lsquo;after the ancient manner&rsquo; represented
      Heracles; the thirty such stones which the Pharæans in like fashion
      worshipped for the gods; and that one which received such honour in
      Boeotian festivals as representing the Thespian Eros.&rdquo; Such also was
      the conical pillar of Asiatic type which stood instead of an image of the
      Paphian Aphrodite, and the conical stone worshipped in Attica under the
      name of Apollo. A sacred boulder lay in front of the temple of the
      Trozenians, while another in Argos bore the significant name of Zeus
      Kappotas. &ldquo;Among all the Greeks,&rdquo; says Pausanias, &ldquo;rude
      stones were worshipped before the images of the gods.&rdquo; Among the
      Semites, in like manner, Melcarth was reverenced at Tyre under the form of
      two stone pillars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intermediate forms, in which the stone takes successively a face, a head,
      arms, legs, a shapely and well-moulded body, are familiar to all of us in
      existing remains. The well-known figures of Priapus form a good
      transitional example. &ldquo;At Tâbala, in Arabia,&rdquo; says Professor
      Robertson Smith, &ldquo;a sort of crown was sculptured on the stone of
      al-Lat to mark her head.&rdquo; Indeed, to the last, the pillar or
      monolithic type is constantly suggested in the erect attitude and the
      proportions of the statue among all except the highest Hellenic examples.
      I may add, that even in Islam itself, which so sternly forbids images of
      any sort, some traces of such anthropomorphic gravestones may still be
      found. I noticed in the mosque of Mehemet Ali at Cairo that the headstones
      of the Vice-regal family were each adorned with a fez and tassel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that the obelisk, also, doubtless owes its origin to
      the monolith or standing stone. Whatever fresh <span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>sacredness it may later have obtained from
      the associations of sun-worship, as a solar ray, cannot mask for any wide
      anthropological enquirer the fact that it is by descent a mere shapeless
      head-stone, with a new symbolic meaning given to it (as so often happens)
      in a new religion. The two obelisks&rsquo; which stand so often before
      Egyptian temples are clearly the analogues of the two pillars of Melcarth
      at Tyre, and the sacred pair at Paphos, Hera-polis, and Solomon&rsquo;s
      temple. In the same way, the Indian tope and the pyramid are descendants
      of the cairn, as the great stone-built tombs of the Numidian kings in
      Algeria seem to be more advanced equivalents of the tumulus or round
      barrow. And let me clear the ground here for what is to follow by adding
      most emphatically that the genesis of stone-worship here sketched out
      precludes the possibility of phallic worship being in any sense a
      primitive form of it. The standing stone may have been, and doubtless
      often was, in later stages; identified with a phallus; but if the theory
      here advocated is true, the lingam, instead of lying at the root of the
      monolith, must necessarily be a later and derivative form of it. At the
      same time, the stone being regarded as the ancestor of the family, it is
      not unnatural that early men should sometimes carve it into a phallic
      shape. Having said this, I will say no more on the subject, which has
      really extremely little to do with the essentials of stone worship, save
      that on many gravestones of early date a phallus marked the male sex of
      the occupant, while breasts, or a symbolical triangle, or a mandorla,
      marked the grave of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, both forms of god, the most primitive and the most finished,
      the rude stone and the perfect statue, exist side by side in the same
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the legendary origin of Jagannath,&rdquo; says Sir William
      Hunter, &ldquo;we find the aboriginal people worshipping a blue stone in
      the depths of the forest. But the deity at length wearies of primitive
      jungle offerings, and longs for the cooked food of the more civilised
      Aryans, upon <span class="pagenum">106</span><a name="link106" id="link106"></a>whose
      arrival on the scene the rude blue stone gives place to a carved image. At
      the present hour, in every hamlet of Orissa, this twofold worship
      coexists. The common people have their shapeless stone or block, which
      they adore with simple rites in the open air; while side by side with it
      stands a temple to one of the Aryan gods, with its carved idol and
      elaborate rites.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Where many sacred stones exist all round, marking the graves of the dead,
      or inhabited by their spirits, it is not surprising, once more, that a
      general feeling of reverence towards all stones should begin to arise&mdash;that
      the stone per se, especially if large, odd, or conspicuous, should be
      credited to some extent with indwelling divinity. Nor is it astonishing
      that the idea of men being descended from stones should be rife among
      people who must often, when young, have been shown headstones, monoliths,
      boulders, or cromlechs, and been told that the offerings made upon them
      were gifts to their ancestors. They would accept the idea as readily as
      our own children accept the Hebrew myth of the creation of Adam, our prime
      ancestor, from &ldquo;the dust of the ground&rdquo;&mdash;a far less
      promising material than a block of marble or sandstone. In this way, it
      seems to me, we can most readily understand the numerous stories of men
      becoming stones, and stones becoming men, which are rife among the myths
      of savage or barbarous peoples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernandez de Piedrahita says that the Laches &ldquo;worshipped every stone
      as a god, as they said they had all been men.&rdquo; Arriaga tells us the
      Peruvians paid honour to &ldquo;very large stones, saying that they were
      once men.&rdquo; In the American <i>Report of the Bureau of Ethnology for
      1880</i>, several stories are told of metamorphosis of men into stones
      from the Iroquois legends. According to Dorman, the Oneidas and Dakotahs
      claim descent from stones, to which they ascribe animation. An interesting
      intermediate form, which shows the growth of this idea, is given in
      Arriaga&rsquo;s statement that the Marcayoc, or idol worshipped in <span
      class="pagenum">107</span><a name="link107" id="link107"></a>Peru as the
      patron of the village, &ldquo;is sometimes a stone and sometimes a mummy&rdquo;:
      in other words, it depended upon circumstances whether they reverenced the
      body itself or the gravestone that covered it. Among the Coast Negroes,
      when a person dies, a stone is taken to a certain house&mdash;the village
      valhalla&mdash;to represent his ghost; and among the Bulloms, women
      &ldquo;make occasional sacrifices and offerings of rice to the stones
      which are preserved in memory of the dead.&rdquo; At Tanna, in the New
      Hebrides, Mr. Gray, a missionary, found &ldquo;a piece of sacred ground,
      on which were deposited the stones in which they supposed the spirits of
      their departed relatives to reside&rdquo;; and Commander Henderson,
      commenting upon a similar case from Vati Island, says these &ldquo;were
      the only form of gods the natives possessed, and into them they supposed
      the souls of their departed friends and relatives to enter.&rdquo; Some of
      them &ldquo;had a small piece chipped out on one side, by means of which
      the indwelling ghost or spirit was supposed to have ingress or egress.&rdquo;
      Of a third sort, rudely fashioned by hand, Captain Henderson says acutely,
      &ldquo;these, it seemed to me, were the beginnings of a graven image&mdash;a
      common stone, sacred as the dwelling-place of an ancestral ghost.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I owe this and several other references to Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s
     Appendix, as I do some of my previously cited cases to Mr.
     Lang or Dr. Tylor.
</pre>
    <p>
      Classical and Hebrew literature are full of examples of such stones,
      believed to have been once human. Niobe and Lot&rsquo;s wife are instances
      that will at once occur to every reader. In Boeotia, Pausanias tells us,
      people believed Alkmene, the mother of Herakles, was changed into a stone.
      Perseus and the Gorgon&rsquo;s head is another example, paralleled by the
      Breton idea that their great stone circles were people, who, in the modern
      Christianised version of the story, were turned into stone for dancing on
      a Sunday. (About this Christianisation I shall have a word to say further
      on; meanwhile, observe the similar name of the Giant&rsquo;s Dance given
      to the great Stonehenge <span class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108"
      id="link108"></a>of Ireland.) In the same way there is a Standing Rock on
      the upper Missouri which parallels the story of Niobe&mdash;it was once a
      woman, who became petrified with grief when her husband took a second
      wife. Some Samoan gods (or ancestral ghosts) &ldquo;were changed into
      stones,&rdquo; says Mr. Turner, &ldquo;and now stand up in a rocky part of
      the lagoon on the north side of Upolu.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if men become stones, stones also become men, or at
      least give birth to men. We get a good instance of this in the legend of
      Deucalion. Again, by the roadside, near the city of the Panopoeans, lay
      the stones out of which Prometheus made men. Manke, the first man in
      Mitchell Island, came out of a stone. The inhabitants of the New Hebrides
      say that &ldquo;the human race sprang from stones and the earth.&rdquo; On
      Francis Island, says Mr. Turner, &ldquo;close by the temple there was a
      seven-feet-long beach sandstone slab erected, before which offerings were
      laid as the people united for prayer&rdquo;; and the natives here told him
      that one of their gods had made stones become men. &ldquo;In Melanesia,&rdquo;
      says Mr. Lang, &ldquo;matters are so mixed that it is not easy to decide
      whether a worshipful stone is the dwelling of a dead man&rsquo;s soul, or
      is of spiritual merit in itself, or whether the stone is the spirit&rsquo;s
      outward part or organ.&rdquo; And, indeed, a sort of general confusion
      between the stone, the ghost, the ancestor, and the god, at last pervades
      the mind of the stone-worshipper everywhere. &ldquo;The curious
      anthropomorphic idea of stones being husbands and wives, and even having
      children,&rdquo; as Dr. Tylor calls it&mdash;an idea familiar to the
      Fijians as to the Peruvians and Lapps&mdash;is surely explicable at once
      by the existence of headstones either to men or women, and the confusion
      between the mark and the ghost it commemorates.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting side-point in this gradual mixing up of the ghost and the
      stone, the god and the image, is shown in a gradual change of detail as to
      the mode of making offerings at the tomb or shrine. On the great trilithon
      in Tonga, <span class="pagenum">109</span><a name="link109" id="link109"></a>Miss
      Gordon-Cumming tells us, a bowl of kava was placed on a horizontal stone.
      Here it must have been supposed that the ghost itself issued forth
      (perhaps by night) to drink it, as the serpent which represented the
      spirit of Anchises glided from the tomb to lick up the offerings presented
      by Æneas. Gradually, however, as the stone and the ghost get more closely
      connected in idea the offering is made to the monument itself; though in
      the earlier stages the convenience of using the flat altar-stone (wherever
      such exists) as a place of sacrifice for victims probably masks the
      transition even to the worshippers themselves. Dr. Wise saw in the
      Himalayas a group of stones &ldquo;erected to the memory of the petty
      Rajahs of Kolam,&rdquo; where &ldquo;some fifty or sixty unfortunate women
      sacrificed themselves.&rdquo; The blood, in particular, is offered up to
      the ghost; and &ldquo;the cup-hollows which have been found in menhirs and
      dolmens,&rdquo; says Captain Conder, &ldquo;are the indications of the
      libations, often of human blood, once poured on these stones by heathen
      worshippers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cups are often found,&rdquo; says a good Scotch
      observer, &ldquo;on stones connected with the monuments of the dead, such
      as on the covering stones of kistvaens, particularly those of the short or
      rarest form; on the flat stones of cromlechs; and on stones of chambered
      graves.&rdquo; On the top of the cairn at Glen Urquhart, on Loch Ness, is
      an oblong mass of slate-stone, obviously sepulchral, and marked with very
      numerous cups. When the stones are upright the notion of offering the
      blood to the upper part, which represents the face or mouth, becomes very
      natural, and forms a distinct step in the process of anthropomorphisation
      of the headstone into the idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      We get two stages of this evolution side by side in the two deities of the
      Samoyed travelling ark-sledge, &ldquo;one with a stone head, the other a
      mere black stone, both dressed in green robes with red lappets, and both
      smeared with sacrificial blood.&rdquo; In the Indian groups of standing
      stones, representing the Five Pandavas, &ldquo;it is a usual practice,&rdquo;
      <span class="pagenum">110</span><a name="link110" id="link110"></a>says
      Dr. Tylor, &ldquo;to daub each stone with red paint, forming, as it were,
      a great blood-spot where the face would be if it were a shaped idol.&rdquo;
      Mr. Spencer, I think, hits the key-note of this practice in an instructive
      passage. &ldquo;A Dakotah,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;before praying to a
      stone for succour paints it with some red pigment, such as red ochre. Now,
      when we read that along with offerings of milk, honey, fruit, flour, etc.,
      the Bodo and Dhimals offer &lsquo;red lead or cochineal,&rsquo; we may
      suspect that these three colouring matters, having red as their common
      character, are substitutes for blood. The supposed resident ghost was at
      first propitiated by anointing the stone with human blood; and then, in
      default of this, red pigment was used, ghosts and gods being supposed by
      primitive men to be easily deceived by shams.&rdquo; It is possible, too,
      that with the process of idealisation and spiritualisation it might be
      supposed a substitute would please the gods equally well, or that redness
      generally was the equivalent of blood, in the same way as the Chinese burn
      paper money and utensils to set free their ghosts for the use of ancestral
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, it is interesting to note that the faces of many Hindu gods
      are habitually painted red. And that this is the survival of the same
      ancient custom we see in the case of Shashti, protectress of children,
      whose proper representative is &ldquo;a rough stone as big as a man&rsquo;s
      head, smeared with red paint, and set at the foot of the sacred vata-tree.&rdquo;
      Like customs survived in Greece down to the classical period. &ldquo;The
      faces of the ancient gilded Dionysi at Corinth,&rdquo; says Mr. Lang,
      quoting Pausanias, &ldquo;were smudged all over with cinnabar, like
      fetish-stones in India or Africa.&rdquo; In early South Italy, too, the
      Priapus-Hermes, who protected the fields, had his face similarly &ldquo;daubed
      with minium.&rdquo; Is it possible to dissever these facts from the
      cannibal banquets of the Aztec gods, where the images had lumps of
      palpitating human flesh thrust into their lips, <span class="pagenum">111</span><a
      name="link111" id="link111"></a>and where their faces were smeared with
      the warm blood of the helpless victims?
    </p>
    <p>
      Only in one instance, however, have I been able to trace the custom of
      painting with red directly back to cannibalism, and that is among the
      man-eaters of the New Hebrides, where, when a man died, and his body was
      laid out in a piece of thick native cloth, &ldquo;the face was kept
      exposed and painted red.&rdquo; I believe with this practice must
      ultimately be correlated the red-painted faces of the Corinthian Dionysi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another point of considerable interest and importance in the evolution of
      stone worship is connected with the migration of sacred stones. When the
      Israelites left Egypt, according to the narrative in Exodus, they carried
      the bones of Joseph with them. When Rachel left her father&rsquo;s tent
      she stole the family teraphim to accompany her on her wanderings. When
      Æneas flew from burning Troy, he bore away to his ships his country&rsquo;s
      gods, his Lares and Penates. All of these tales, no doubt, are equally
      unhistorical, but they represent what, to the people who framed the
      legends, seemed perfectly natural and probable conduct. Just in the same
      way, when stone-worshippers migrate from one country to another, they are
      likely to carry with them their sacred stones, or at least the most
      portable or holiest of the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a very good illustrative case, once more from that most valuable
      storehouse, Turner&rsquo;s <i>Samoa</i>. The Fijian gods and goddesses we
      saw, according to Tylor, &ldquo;had their abodes or shrines in black
      stones like smooth round millstones, and there received their offerings of
      food.&rdquo; But on a certain Samoan island, says Mr. Turner, &ldquo;In a
      district said to have been early populated by settlers from Fiji, a number
      of fancy Fijian stones were kept in a temple, and worshipped in time of
      war. The priest, in consulting them, built them up in the form of a wall,
      and then watched to see how they fell. If they fell to the westward, it
      was a sign that the enemy there was to be <span class="pagenum">112</span><a
      name="link112" id="link112"></a>driven; but if they fell to eastward, that
      was a warning of defeat, and delay in making an attack was ordered
      accordingly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot find room here for many detailed instances of similar migrations;
      but there are two examples in Britain so exceedingly interesting that even
      in so hasty a notice I cannot pass them by without a brief mention. The
      inner or smaller stones at Stonehenge are known to be of remote origin,
      belonging to rocks not found nearer Salisbury Plain than Cumberland in one
      direction or Belgium in the other. They are surrounded by a group of much
      larger stones, arranged as trilithons, but carved out of the common sarsen
      blocks distributed over the neighbouring country. I have tried to show
      elsewhere that these smaller igneous rocks, untouched by the tool, * were
      the ancient sacred stones of an immigrant tribe that came into Britain
      from the Continent, probably over a broad land-belt which then existed
      where the Straits of Dover now flow; and that the strangers on their
      arrival in Britain erected these their ancestral gods on the Plain of
      Amesbury, and further contributed to their importance and appearance by
      surrounding them with a circle of the biggest and most imposing
      grey-wethers that the new country in which they had settled could easily
      afford.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * So Moses in the legend commanded the children of Israel to
     build &ldquo;an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift
     up any iron&rdquo;; and so of the boulders composing the altar on
     Mount Ebal it was said, &ldquo;Thou shah not lift up any iron tool
     upon them.&rdquo; The conservatism of religion kept up the archaic
     fashion for sacred purposes.
</pre>
    <p>
      The other case is that of the Scone stone. This sacred block, according to
      the accredited legend, was originally the ancestral god of the Irish
      Scots, on whose royal tumulus at Tara it once stood. It was carried by
      them to Argyllshire on their first invasion, and placed in a cranny of the
      wall (say modern versions) at Dunstaffnage Castle. When the Scotch kings
      removed to Scone, Kenneth II. took the stone to his new lowland residence.
      Thence Edward I. <span class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113"
      id="link113"></a>carried it off to England, where it has ever since
      remained in Westminster Abbey, as part of the chair in which the
      sovereigns of Britain sit at their coronation. The immense significance of
      these facts or tales will be seen more clearly when we come to consider
      the analogies of the Hebrew ark. Meanwhile, it may help to explain the
      coronation usage, and the legend that wherever the Stone of Destiny is
      found &ldquo;the Scots in place must reign,&rdquo; if I add a couple of
      analogous cases from the history of the same mixed Celtic race. According
      to Dr. O&rsquo;Donovan, the inauguration stone of the O&rsquo;Donnells
      stood on a tumulus in the midst of a large plain; and on this sacred
      stone, called the Flagstone of the Kings, the elected chief stood to
      receive the white wand or sceptre of kingship. A cylindrical obelisk, used
      for the same purpose, stands to this day, according to Dr. Petrie, in the
      Rath-na-Riogh. So, too, M&rsquo;Donald was crowned King of the Isles,
      standing on a sacred stone, with an impression on top to receive his feet.
      He based himself, as it were, upon the gods his ancestors. The Tara stone
      even cried aloud, Professor Rhys tells us, when the true king placed his
      feet above it. The coronation stone exists in other countries; for
      example, in Hebrew history, or half-history, we learn that when Abimelech
      was mads king it was &ldquo;by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem&rdquo;;
      and when Jehoash was anointed by Jehoiada, &ldquo;the king stood by a
      pillar, as the manner was.&rdquo; In front of the church of Sant&rsquo;
      Ambrogio at Milan stands the stone pillar at which the Lombard kings and
      German emperors took the coronation oath, under the ancient lime-trees
      which overshadow the piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it is quite true that Mr. Skene, the best authority on Celtic
      Scotland, rejects this story of the Stone of Destiny in most parts as
      legendary: he believes the Scone stone to have been merely the sacred
      coronation-block of the Pictish Kings at Scone, and never to have come
      from Ireland at all. Professor Ramsay thinks it is a piece of red <span
      class="pagenum">114</span><a name="link114" id="link114"></a>sandstone
      broken off the rock of that district of Scotland. Even Professor Rhys (who
      gives a most interesting account of the Tara Stone) seems to have doubts
      as to the migration. But, true or not, the story will amply serve my
      purpose here; for I use it only to illustrate the equally dubious
      wanderings of a Hebrew sacred stone, at which we will arrive in due time;
      and one legend is surely always the best possible parallel of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of ages, as religions develop, and especially as a few great
      gods grow to overshadow the minor ancestral Lares and spirits, it often
      comes about that sacred stones of the older faith have a new religious
      significance given them in the later system. Thus we have seen the Argives
      worshipped their old sacred stone under the name of Zeus Kappotas; the
      Thespians identified theirs with the later Hellenic Eros; and the
      Megarians considered a third as the representative of Phoebus. The
      original local sacred stone of Delos has been found on the spot where it
      originally stood, beneath the feet of the statue of the Delian Apollo. And
      this, I am glad to see, is Mr. Andrew Lang&rsquo;s view also; for he
      remarks of the Greek unwrought stones, &ldquo;They were blocks which bore
      the names of gods, Hera, or Apollo, names perhaps given, as De Brosses
      says, to the old fetishistic objects of worship, <i>after</i> the
      anthropomorphic gods entered [I should say, were developed in] Hellas.&rdquo;
      So, too, in India, the local sacred stones have been identified with the
      deities of the Hindu pantheon; Mr. Hislop remarks that in every part of
      the Deccan (where Hinduism is of comparatively late introduction) four or
      five stones may often be seen in the ryot&rsquo;s field, placed in a row
      and daubed with red paint, which the peasants call the Five Pandavas; but,
      says Dr. Tylor, &ldquo;he reasonably takes these Hindu names to have
      superseded more ancient appellations.&rdquo; Islam, in like manner, has
      adopted the Kaaba, the great black stone of the Holy Place at Mecca; and
      the Egyptian religion gave <span class="pagenum">115</span><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a>a new meaning to the pillar or monolith,
      by shaping it as an obelisk to represent a ray of the rising sun-god.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the sanctity of the antique stones was secured in the later
      faith by connecting them with some legend or episode of the orthodox
      religion. Thus the ancient sacred stone kept at Delphi&mdash;no doubt the
      original oracle of that great shrine, as the rude Delian block was the
      precursor of the Delian Apollo&mdash;was explained with reference to the
      later Hellenic belief by the myth that it was the stone which Kronos
      swallowed in mistake for Zeus: an explanation doubtless due to the fact
      that this boulder was kept, like Monigan&rsquo;s Irish idol and the Samoan
      god, wrapped up in flannel; and in the myth, Rhea deceived Kronos by
      offering him, instead of Zeus, a stone wrapped in swaddling-bands. There
      is here indeed food for much reflection. The sacred stone of the
      Trozenians, in like manner, lay in front of the temple; but it was
      Hellenised, so to speak, by the story that on it the Trozenian elders sat
      when they purified Orestes from the murder of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      In modern Europe, as everybody knows, a similar Christianisation of holy
      wells, holy stones, and holy places has been managed by connecting them
      with legends of saints, or by the still simpler device of marking a cross
      upon them. The cross has a threefold value: in the first place, it drives
      away from their accustomed haunts the ancient gods or spirits, always
      envisaged in early Christian and mediæval thought as devils or demons; in
      the second place, it asserts the supremacy of the new faith; and in the
      third place, by conferring a fresh sanctity upon the old holy place or
      object, it induces the people to worship the cross by the mere habit of
      resorting to the shrine at which their ancestors so long worshipped.
      Gregory&rsquo;s well-known advice to St. Augustine on this matter is but a
      single example of what went on over all Christendom. In many cases,
      crosses in Britain are still found firmly fixed in old sacred stones,
      usually recognisable by their unwrought condition. The finest <span
      class="pagenum">116</span><a name="link116" id="link116"></a>example in
      Europe is probably the gigantic monolith of Plumen in Brittany, topped by
      an insignificant little cross, and still resorted to by the peasants
      (especially the childless) as a great place of worship. The prehistoric
      monuments of Narvia in the Isle of Man have been Christianised by having
      crosses deeply incised upon them. Other cases, like the Black Stones of
      Iona, which gave sanctity to that Holy Isle long before the time of
      Columba, will doubtless occur at once to every reader. With many of the
      Scotch sculptured stones, it is difficult to decide whether they were
      originally erected as crosses, or are prehistoric monuments externally
      Christianised.

    <p>
      I have thus endeavoured briefly to suggest the ultimate derivation of all
      sacred stones from sepulchral monuments, and to point out the very large
      part which they bear in the essential of religion&mdash;that is to say,
      worship&mdash;everywhere. There is, however, one particular application to
      which I wish to call special attention, because of its peculiar interest
      as regards the origin of the monotheistic god of Judaism and Christianity.
      Hitherto in this chapter, I have intentionally made but very few allusions
      to the faith and the sacred stones of the Hebrews, because I wished first
      to give a general view of the whole ramifications and modifications of
      stone-worship before coming down to the particular instance in which we
      modern Europeans are most deeply interested. I will now, however, give a
      brief summary of what seems to me most suggestive and important in the
      early Semitic stone-cult. These results are no doubt already familiar in
      outline to most cultivated readers, but it is possible they may appear in
      a somewhat new light when regarded in connexion with the general history
      of stone-worship as here elucidated.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Semites, as well as other early nations, were stone-worshippers
      we know from a great number of positive instances. The stone pillars of
      Baal and the wooden Ashera cones were the chief objects of adoration in
      the Phoenician religion. The Stone of Bethel was apparently a menhir:
      <span class="pagenum">117</span><a name="link117" id="link117"></a>the
      cairn of Mizpeh was doubtless a sepulchral monument. The Israelites under
      Joshua, we are told, built a Gilgal of twelve standing stones; and other
      instances in the early traditions of the Hebrews will be noticed in their
      proper place later on. Similarly, among the Arabs of the time of Mohammed,
      two of the chief deities were Manah and Lât, the one a rock, the other a
      sacred stone or stone idol: and the Kaaba itself, the great black stone of
      local worship, even the Prophet was compelled to recognise and Islamise by
      adopting it bodily into his monotheistic religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone worship of the Semites at large, though comparatively neglected
      by Professor Robertson Smith, must have played a large part in the
      religion of that race, from which the Hebrews were a special offshoot.
      &ldquo;In Arabia,&rdquo; says Professor Smith, &ldquo;where sacrifice by
      fire was almost unknown, we find no proper altar, but in its place a rude
      pillar or heap of stones, beside which the victim is slain, the blood
      being poured out over the stone or at its base.&rdquo; To the great
      orientalist, it is true, the sacred stone or altar, like the sacred tree
      and the sacred fountain, are nothing more than &ldquo;common symbols at
      sanctuaries&rdquo;; he thinks of them not as gods but merely as
      representatives of the god, arbitrarily chosen. After the evidence I have
      already adduced, however, I think it will be seen that this position is
      altogether untenable; indeed, Dr. Smith himself uses many phrases in this
      connexion which enables us to see the true state of the case far more
      clearly than he himself did. &ldquo;The sacred stones [of the Arabs],
      which are already mentioned by Herodotus, are called <i>ansab</i>, i.e.,
      stones set up, pillars. We also find the name <i>ghariy</i>,
      'blood-bedaubed,&rsquo; with reference to the ritual just described [of
      sacrifice at the <i>nosb</i> or sacred pillar]. The meaning of this ritual
      will occupy us later: meantime the thing to be noted is that the altar is
      only a modification of the <i>nosb</i>, and that the rude Arabian usage is
      the primitive type out of which all the elaborate altar ceremonies of the
      <span class="pagenum">118</span><a name="link118" id="link118"></a>more
      cultivated Semites grew. Whatever else was done in connexion with a
      sacrifice, the primitive rite of sprinkling or dashing the blood against
      the altar, or allowing it to flow down on the ground at its base, was
      hardly ever omitted; and this practice was not peculiar to the Semites,
      but was equally the rule with the Greeks and Romans, and indeed with the
      ancient nations generally.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; says Professor Smith again, &ldquo;that the
      original altar among the Northern Semites, as well as among the Arabs, was
      a great stone or cairn, at which the blood of the victim was shed.&rdquo;
      There is no difference, he declares, between the Hebrew altar and the
      Arabian standing stone. &ldquo;Monolithic pillars or cairns of stone are
      frequently mentioned in the more ancient parts of the Old Testament as
      standing at Sanctuaries, generally in connexion with a sacred legend about
      the occasion on which they were set up by some famous patriarch or hero.
      In the biblical story, they usually appear as mere memorial structures
      without any definite ritual significance; but the pentateuchal law looks
      on the use of sacred pillars as idolatrous. This is the best evidence that
      such pillars held an important place among the appurtenances of Canaanite
      temples; and as Hosea speaks of the pillar as an indispensable feature in
      the sanctuaries of Northern Israel in his time, we may be sure that by the
      mass of the Hebrews the pillars of Shechem, Bethel, Gilgal, and other
      shrines were looked upon, not as mere memorials of historical events, but
      as necessary parts of the ritual apparatus of a place of worship.... From
      these evidences, and especially from the fact that libations of the same
      kind are applied to both, it seems clear that the altar is a
      differentiated form of the primitive rude stone pillar. But the sacred
      stone is more than an altar, for in Hebrew and Canaanite sanctuaries the
      altar, in its developed form as a table or hearth, does not supersede the
      pillar; the two are found side by side at the same sanctuary, the altar as
      a piece of sacrificial apparatus, and the pillar as a visible symbol or
      embodiment of the <span class="pagenum">119</span><a name="link119"
      id="link119"></a>presence of the deity, which in process of time comes to
      be fashioned and carved in various ways, till ultimately it becomes a
      statue or anthropomorphic idol of stone, just as the sacred tree or post
      was ultimately developed into an image of wood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of much obvious groping in the dark in this and other passages of
      the <i>Religion of the Semites</i>, it is clear that the learned professor
      recognised at least one central fact&mdash;&ldquo;the sacred stone at
      Semitic sanctuaries was from the first an object of worship, a sort of
      rude idol in which the divinity was somehow supposed to be present.&rdquo;
      Again, he notes that &ldquo;Jacob&rsquo;s pillar is more than a mere
      landmark, for it is anointed, just as idols were in antiquity, and the
      pillar itself, not the spot on which it stood, is called &lsquo;the house
      of God,&rsquo; as if the deity were conceived actually to dwell in the
      stone, or manifest himself therein to his worshippers. And this is the
      conception which appears to have been associated with sacred stones
      everywhere. When the Arab daubed blood on the <i>nosh</i>, his object was
      to bring the offering into direct contact with the deity; and in like
      manner the practice of stroking the sacred stone with the hand is
      identical with the practice of touching or stroking the garments or beard
      of a man in acts of supplication before him.&rdquo; Elsewhere he says:
      &ldquo;So far as evidence from tradition and ritual goes, we can only
      think of the sacred stone as consecrated by the actual presence of the
      godhead, so that whatever touched it was brought into immediate contact
      with the deity.&rdquo; And he quotes a line from an Arab poet in which the
      Arabian gods are expressly described as &ldquo;gods of stone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thus clear that sacred stones were common objects of worship with
      the Semites in general, and also with the Hebrew people in particular. But
      after the exclusive worship of Jahweh, the local Jewish god, had grown
      obligatory among the Jews, it became the policy of the &ldquo;Jehovist&rdquo;
      priests to Jehovise and to consecrate the sacred stones of Palestine by
      bringing them into connexion <span class="pagenum">120</span><a
      name="link120" id="link120"></a>with the Jehovistic legend and the tales
      of the Patriarchs. Thus Professor Cheyne comments as follows upon the
      passage in Isaiah where the prophet mocks the partizan of the old
      polytheistic creed as a stone-worshipper&mdash;&ldquo;Among the smooth
      stones of the valley is thy portion: They, they are thy lot: Even to them
      hast thou poured a drink offering: Thou hast offered a meat offering:
      &ldquo;The large smooth stones referred to above were the fetishes of the
      primitive Semitic races, and anointed with oil, according to a widely
      spread custom. It was such a stone which Jacob took for a pillow, and
      afterwards consecrated by pouring oil upon it. The early Semites and
      reactionary idolatrous Israelites called such stones Bethels.... i.e.,
      houses of <i>El</i> (the early Semitic word for God) *.... In spite of the
      efforts of the &lsquo;Jehovist&rsquo; who desired to convert these ancient
      fetishes into memorials of patriarchal history, the old heathenish use of
      them seems to have continued especially in secluded places.&rdquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Say rather, &ldquo;for a god.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Besides the case of the stone at Bethel, there is the later one (in our
      narrative) when Jacob and Laban made a covenant, &ldquo;and Jacob took a
      stone, and set it up for a pillar. And Jacob said unto his brethren,
      Gather stones; and they took stones and made an heap: and they did eat
      there upon the heap.&rdquo; So, once more, at Shalem, he erects an altar
      called El-Elohe-Israel; he sets a pillar upon the grave of Rachel, and
      another at the place at Luz where God appeared to him. Of like import is
      the story of the twelve stones which the twelve men take out of Jordan to
      commemorate the passage of the tribes. All are clearly attempts to
      Jehovise these early sacred stones or local gods by connecting them with
      incidents in the Jehovistic version of the ancient Hebrew legends.
    </p>
    <p>
      That such stones, however, were worshipped as deities in early times,
      before the cult of Jahweh had become an exclusive one among his devotees,
      is evident from the Jehovistic <span class="pagenum">121</span><a
      name="link121" id="link121"></a>narrative itself, which has not wholly
      succeeded in blotting out all traces of earlier religion. Samuel judged
      Israel every year at Bethel, the place of Jacob&rsquo;s sacred pillar: at
      Gilgal, the place where Joshua&rsquo;s twelve stones were set up; and at
      Mizpeh, where stood the cairn surmounted by the pillar of Laban&rsquo;s
      covenant. In other words, these were the sanctuaries of the chief ancient
      gods of Israel. Samuel himself &ldquo;took a stone and set it between
      Mizpeh and Shem and its very name, Eben-ezer, &ldquo;the stone of help,&rdquo;
      shows that it was originally worshipped before proceeding on warlike
      expeditions, though the Jehovistic gloss, &ldquo;saying, Hitherto the Lord
      hath helped us,&rdquo; does its best, of course, to obscure the real
      meaning. So at Peran, in New Guinea, Mr. Chalmers saw &ldquo;a large
      peculiarly-shaped stone,&rdquo; by name Ravai, considered very sacred.
      Sacrifices are made to it, and it is more particularly addressed in times
      of fighting. &ldquo;Before setting forth, offerings are presented, with
      food,&rdquo; and the stone is entreated to precede the warriors into
      battle. Wherever a stone has a name, it is almost certainly of mortuary
      origin. It was to the stone-circle of Gilgal, once more, that Samuel
      directed Saul to go, saying, &ldquo;I will come down unto thee, to offer
      burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings.&rdquo; It
      was at the cairn of Mizpeh that Saul was chosen king; and after the
      victory over the Ammonites, Saul went once more to the great Stonehenge at
      Gilgal to &ldquo;renew the kingdom,&rdquo; and &ldquo;there they made Saul
      king before Jahweh in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of
      peace-offerings before Jahweh.&rdquo; This passage is a very instructive
      and important one, because here we see that in the opinion of the writer
      at least Jahweh was then domiciled at Gilgal, amid the other sacred stones
      of that holy circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe, &ldquo;however, that when Saul was directed to go to find his
      father&rsquo;s asses, he was sent first to Rachel&rsquo;s pillar at
      Telzah, and then to the plain of Tabor, where he was to meet &ldquo;three
      men going up to God [not to Jahweh] at Bethel,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">122</span><a
      name="link122" id="link122"></a>evidently to sacrifice, &ldquo;one
      carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and
      another carrying a bottle of wine.&rdquo; These and many other like
      memorials of stone-worship lie thickly scattered through the early books
      of the Hebrew Scriptures, sometimes openly avowed, and sometimes cloaked
      under a thin veil of Jehovism.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, at the present day, the Palestine exploration has shown
      that no rude stone monuments exist in Palestine proper, though east of the
      Jordan they are common in all parts of the country. How, then, are we to
      explain their disappearance? Major Conder thinks that when pure Jehovism
      finally triumphed under Hezekiah and Josiah, the Jehovists destroyed all
      these &ldquo;idolatrous&rdquo; stones throughout the Jewish dominions, in
      accordance with the injunctions in the Book of Deuteronomy to demolish the
      religious emblems of the Canaanites. Jahweh, the god of the Hebrews, was a
      jealous God, and he would tolerate no alien sacred stones within his own
      jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who or what was this Jahweh himself, this local and ethnic god of the
      Israelites, who would suffer no other god or sacred monolith to live near
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not lay stress upon the point that when Joshua was dying, according
      to the legend, he &ldquo;took a great stone&rdquo; and set it up by an oak
      that was by the sanctuary of Jahweh, saying that it had heard all the
      words of Jahweh. That document is too doubtful in terms to afford us much
      authority. But I will merely point out that at the time when we first seem
      to catch clear historic glimpses of true Jahweh worship, we find Jahweh,
      whoever or whatever that mystic object might have been, located with his
      ark at the Twelve Stones at Gilgal. It is quite clear that in &ldquo;the
      camp at Gilgal,&rdquo; as the later compilers believed, Jahweh, god of
      Israel, who had brought his people up out of Egypt, remained till the
      conquest of the land was completed. But after the end of the conquest, the
      <span class="pagenum">123</span><a name="link123" id="link123"></a>tent in
      which he dwelt was removed to Shiloh; and that Jahweh went with it is
      clear from the fact that Joshua cast lots for the land there &ldquo;before
      Jahweh, our God.&rdquo; He was there still when Hannah and her husband
      went up to Shiloh to sacrifice unto Jahweh; and when Samuel ministered
      unto Jahweh before Eli the priest. That Jahweh made a long stay at Shiloh
      is, therefore, it would seem, a true old tradition&mdash;a tradition of
      the age just before the historical beginnings of the Hebrew annals.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jahweh was an object of portable size, for, omitting for the present
      the descriptions in the Pentateuch, which seem likely to be of late date,
      and not too trustworthy, through their strenuous Jehovistic editing, he
      was carried from Shiloh in his ark to the front during the great battle
      with the Philistines at Ebenezer; and the Philistines were afraid, for
      they said, &ldquo;A god is come into the camp.&rdquo; But when the
      Philistines captured the ark, the rival god, Dagon, fell down and broke in
      pieces&mdash;so Hebrew legend declared&mdash;before the face of Jahweh.
      After the Philistines restored the sacred object, it rested for a time at
      Kirjath-jearim, till David, on the capture of Jerusalem from the
      Jebusites, went down to that place to bring up from thence the ark of the
      god; and as it went, on a new cart, they &ldquo;played before Jahweh on
      all manner of instruments,&rdquo; and David himself &ldquo;danced before
      Jahweh.&rdquo; Jahweh was then placed in the tent or tabernacle that David
      had prepared for him, till Solomon built the first temple, &ldquo;the
      house of Jahweh,&rdquo; and Jahweh&rsquo;s ark was set up in it, &ldquo;in
      the oracle of the house, the most holy place, even under the wings of the
      cherubim.&rdquo; Just so Mr. Chalmers tells us that when he was at Peran,
      in New Guinea, the peculiarly-shaped holy stone, Ravai, and the two wooden
      idols, Epe and Kivava, &ldquo;made long ago and considered very sacred,&rdquo;
      were for the moment &ldquo;located in an old house, until all the
      arrangements necessary for their removal to the splendid new dubu prepared
      for them are completed.&rdquo; And so, too, at the opposite end of the
      scale of civilisation, as Mr. <span class="pagenum">124</span><a
      name="link124" id="link124"></a>Lang puts it, &ldquo;the fetish-stones of
      Greece were those which occupied the holy of holies of the most ancient
      temples, the mysterious fanes within dark cedar or cypress groves, to
      which men were hardly admitted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That Jahweh himself, in the most ancient traditions of the race, was
      similarly concealed within his chest or ark in the holy of holies, is
      evident, I think, to any attentive reader. It is true, the later
      Jehovistic glosses of Exodus and Deuteronomy, composed after the
      Jehovistic worship had become purified and spiritualised, do their best to
      darken the comprehension of this matter by making the presence of Jahweh
      seem always incorporeal; and even in the earlier traditions, the phrase
      &ldquo;the ark of the covenant of Jahweh&rdquo; is often substituted for
      the simpler and older one, &ldquo;the ark of Jahweh.&rdquo; But through
      all the disfigurements with which the priestly scribes of the age of
      Josiah and the sacerdotalists of the return from the captivity have
      overlaid the primitive story, we can still see clearly in many places that
      Jahweh himself was at first personally present in the ark that covered
      him. And though the scribes (evidently ashamed of the early worship they
      had outlived) protest somewhat vehemently more than once, &ldquo;There was
      nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at
      Horeb, when Jahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they
      came out of the land of Egypt,&rdquo; yet this much at least even they
      admit&mdash;that the object or objects concealed in the ark consisted of a
      sculptured stone or stones; and that to dance or sing before this stone or
      these stones was equivalent to dancing or singing before the face of
      Jahweh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question whether the mysterious body concealed in the ark was or was
      not a lingam or other phallic object I purposely omit to discuss here, as
      not cognate to our present enquiry. It is sufficient to insist that from
      the evidence before us, first, it <i>was</i> Jahweh himself, and second,
      it was an object made of stone. Further than that &lsquo;twere <span
      class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125" id="link125"></a>curious to
      enquire, and I for one do not desire to pry into the mysteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to push the argument too far, then, we may say this much is fairly
      certain. The children of Israel in early times carried about with them a
      tribal god, Jahweh, whose presence in their midst was intimately connected
      with a certain ark or chest, containing a stone object or objects. This
      chest was readily portable, and could be carried to the front in case of
      warfare. They did not know the origin of the object in the ark with
      certainty, but they regarded it emphatically as &ldquo;Jahweh their god,
      which led them out of the land of Egypt.&rdquo; Even after its true nature
      had been spiritualised away into a great national deity, the most
      unlimited and incorporeal the world has ever known (as we get him in the
      best and purest work of the prophets), the imagery of later times
      constantly returns to the old idea of a stone pillar or menhir. In the
      embellished account of the exodus from Egypt, Jahweh goes before the
      Israelites as a pillar or monolith of cloud by day and of fire by night.
      According to Levitical law his altar must be built of unhewn stone,
      &ldquo;for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it.&rdquo;
      It is as a Rock that the prophets often figuratively describe Jahweh,
      using the half-forgotten language of an earlier day to clothe their own
      sublimer and more purified conceptions. It is to the Rock of Israel&mdash;the
      sacred stone of the tribe&mdash;that they look for succour. Nay, even when
      Josiah accepted the forged roll of the law and promised to abide by it,
      &ldquo;the king stood by a pillar (a menhir) and made a covenant before
      Jahweh.&rdquo; Even to the last we see in vague glimpses the real original
      nature of the worship of that jealous god who caused Dagon to break in
      pieces before him, and would allow no other sacred stones to remain
      undemolished within his tribal boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not see, therefore, how we can easily avoid the obvious inference
      that Jahweh, the god of the Hebrews, who later became sublimated and
      etherealised into the God <span class="pagenum">126</span><a name="link126"
      id="link126"></a>of Christianity, was in his origin nothing more nor less
      than the ancestral sacred stone of the people of Israel, however
      sculptured, and perhaps, in the very last resort of all, the unhewn
      monumental pillar of some early Semitic sheikh or chieftain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;SACRED STAKES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ILTON <span
      class="pagenum">127</span><a name="link127" id="link127"></a>speaks in a
      famous sonnet of the time &ldquo;when all our fathers worshipped stocks
      and stones.&rdquo; That familiar and briefly contemptuous phrase of the
      Puritan poet does really cover the vast majority of objects of worship for
      the human race at all times and in all places. We have examined the
      stones; the stocks must now come in for their fair share of attention.
      They need not, however, delay us quite so long as their sister deities,
      both because they are on the whole less important in themselves, and
      because their development from grave-marks into gods and idols is almost
      absolutely parallel to that which we have already followed out in detail
      in the case of the standing stone or megalithic monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stakes or wooden posts are often used all the world over as marks of an
      interment. Like other grave-marks, they also share naturally in the
      honours paid to the ghost or nascent god. But they are less important as
      elements in the growth of religion than standing stones for two distinct
      reasons. In the first place, a stake or post most often marks the
      interment of a person of little social consideration; chiefs and great men
      have usually stone monuments erected in their honour; the commonalty have
      to be satisfied with wooden marks, as one may observe to this day at Père
      Lachaise, or any other great Christian cemetery. In the second place, the
      stone monument is far more lasting and permanent than the wooden one. Each
      of these points counts for something. For it is <span class="pagenum">128</span><a
      name="link128" id="link128"></a>chiefs and great men whose ghosts most
      often grow into gods; and it is the oldest ghosts, the oldest gods, the
      oldest monuments that are always the most sacred. For both these reasons,
      then, the stake is less critical than the stone in the history of
      religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, it has its own special importance. As the sacred stone
      derives ultimately from the great boulder piled above the grave to keep
      down the corpse, so the stake, I believe, derives from the sharp-pointed
      stick driven through the body to pin it down as we saw in the third
      chapter, and still so employed in Christian England to prevent suicides
      from walking. Such a stake or pole is usually permitted to protrude from
      the ground, so as to warn living men of the neighbourhood of a spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a very early date, however, the stake, I fancy, became a mere
      grave-mark; and though, owing to its comparative inconspicuousness, it
      obtains relatively little notice, it is now and always has been by far the
      most common mode of preserving the memory of the spot where a person lies
      buried. A good example, which will throw light upon many subsequent
      modifications, is given by Mr. Wyatt Gill from Port Moresby in New Guinea.
      &ldquo;The body,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was buried. At the side was set up
      a stake, to which were tied the spear, club, bow and arrow of the
      deceased, but broken, to prevent theft. A little beyond was the grave of a
      woman: her cooking utensils, grass petticoats, etc., hung up on the stake.&rdquo;
      Similar customs, he adds, are almost universal in Polynesia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though worship of stakes or wooden posts is common all over the world, I
      can give but few quite unequivocal instances of such worship being paid to
      a post actually known to surmount an undoubted grave. Almost the best
      direct evidence I can obtain is the case of the grave-pole in Buru,
      already quoted from Mr. H. O. Forbes. But the following account of a
      Samoyed place of sacrifice, extracted from Baron Nordenskiold&rsquo;s <i>Voyage
      of the Vega</i>, is certainly suggestive. On a hillock on Vaygats Island
      <span class="pagenum">129</span><a name="link129" id="link129"></a>the
      Swedish explorer found a number of reindeer skulls, so arranged that they
      formed a close thicket of antlers. Around lay other bones, both of bears
      and reindeer; and in the midst of all &ldquo;the mighty beings to whom all
      this splendour was offered. They consisted&rsquo; of hundreds of small
      wooden sticks, the upper portions of which were carved very clumsily in
      the form of the human countenance, most of them from fifteen to twenty,
      but some of them three hundred and seventy centimetres in length. They
      were all stuck in the ground on the southeast part of the eminence. Near
      the place of sacrifice there were to be seen pieces of driftwood and
      remains of the fireplace at which the sacrificial meal was prepared. Our
      guide told us that at these meals the mouths of the idols were besmeared
      with blood and wetted with brandy; and the former statement was confirmed
      by the large spots of blood which were found on most of the large idols
      below the holes intended to represent the mouth.&rdquo; At a far earlier
      date, Stephen Burrough in 1556 writes as follows to much the same effect
      in his interesting narrative printed in Hakluyt: &ldquo;There I met againe
      with Loshak, and went on shore with him, and he brought me to a heap of
      Samoeds idols, which were in number about 300, the worst and the most
      unartificiall worke that ever I saw: the eyes and mouthes of sundrie of
      them were bloodie, they had the shape of men, women, and children, very
      grossly wrought, and that which they had made for other parts was also
      sprinkled with blood. Some of their idols were an olde sticke with two or
      three notches, made with a knife in it. There was one of their sleds
      broken and lay by the heape of idols, and there I saw a deers skinne which
      the foules had spoyled: and before certaine of their idols blocks were
      made as high as their mouthes; being all bloody, I thought that to be the
      table wheron they offered their sacrifice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In neither of these accounts, it is true, is it distinctly mentioned that
      the place of sacrifice was a Samoyed cemetery: <span class="pagenum">130</span><a
      name="link130" id="link130"></a>but I believe this to be the case, partly
      from analogy, and partly because Nordenskiôld mentions elsewhere that an
      upturned sled is a frequent sign of a Samoyed grave. Compare also the
      following account of a graveyard among nominally Christian Ostyak
      Siberians, also from Nordenskiôld: &ldquo;The corpses were placed in large
      coffins above ground, at which almost always a cross was erected.&rdquo;
      [The accompanying woodcut shews that these crosses were rude wooden stakes
      with one or two crossbars.] &ldquo;In one of the crosses a sacred picture
      was inserted which must be considered a further proof that a Christian
      rested in the coffin. Notwithstanding this, we found some clothes, which
      had belonged to the departed, hanging on a bush beside the grave, together
      with a bundle containing food, principally dried fish. At the graves of
      the richer natives the survivors are even said to place along with food
      some rouble notes, in order that the departed may not be altogether
      without ready money on his entrance into the other world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To complete the parallel, I ought to add that money was also deposited on
      the sacrificial place on Vaygats Island. Of another such sacrificial place
      on Yalmal, Nordenskiôld says, after describing a pile of bones, reindeer
      skulls, and walrus jaws: &ldquo;In the middle of the heap of bones stood
      four erect pieces of wood. Two consisted of sticks a metre in length, with
      notches cut in them.... The two others, which clearly were the proper
      idols of this place of sacrifice, consisted of driftwood roots, on which
      some carvings had been made to distinguish the eyes, mouth, and nose. The
      parts of the pieces of wood, intended to represent the eyes and mouth, had
      recently been besmeared with blood, and there still lay at the heap of
      bones the entrails of a newly killed reindeer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, I learn from another source that &ldquo;the Samoyedes feed the
      wooden images of the dead&rdquo;; while an instance from Erman helps
      further to confirm the same conclusion. According to that acute writer,
      among the Ostyaks <span class="pagenum">131</span><a name="link131"
      id="link131"></a>of Eastern Siberia there is found a most interesting
      custom, in which, says Dr. Tylor, &ldquo;we see the transition from the
      image of the dead man to the actual idol.&rdquo; When a man dies, they set
      up a rude wooden image of him in the yurt, which receives offerings at
      every meal and has honours paid to it, while the widow continually
      embraces and caresses it. As a general rule, these images are buried at
      the end of three years or so: but sometimes &ldquo;the image of a shaman
      (native sorcerer),&rdquo; says Tylor, &ldquo;is set up permanently, and
      remains as a saint for ever.&rdquo; For &ldquo;saint&rdquo; I should say
      &ldquo;god&rdquo;; and we see the transformation at once completed.
      Indeed, Erman adds acutely about the greater gods of the Ostyaks: &ldquo;That
      these latter also have a historical origin, that they were originally
      monuments of distinguished men, to which prescription and the interest of
      the Shamans gave by degrees an arbitrary meaning and importance, seems to
      me not liable to doubt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the blood smeared upon such Siberian wooden idols, it must
      be remembered that bowls of blood are common offerings to the dead; and
      Dr. Robertson Smith himself, no friendly witness in this matter, has
      compared the blood-offerings to ghosts with those to deities. In the
      eleventh book of the Odyssey, for example, the ghosts drink greedily of
      the sacrificial blood; and libations of gore form a special feature in
      Greek offerings to heroes. That blood was offered to the sacred stones we
      have already seen; and we noticed that there as here it was specially
      smeared upon the parts representing the mouth. Offerings of blood to gods,
      or pouring of blood on altars, are too common to demand particular notice;
      and we shall also recur to that part of the subject when we come to
      consider the important questions of sacrifice and sacrament. I will only
      add here that according to Maimonides the Sabians looked on blood as the
      nourishment of the gods; while the Hebrew Jahweh asks indignantly in the
      fiftieth <span class="pagenum">132</span><a name="link132" id="link132"></a>Psalm,
      &ldquo;Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To pass on to more unequivocal cases of stake-worship, where we can hardly
      doubt that the stake represents a dead man, Captain Cook noticed that in
      the Society Islands &ldquo;the carved wooden images at burial-places were
      not considered mere memorials, but abodes into which the souls of the
      departed retired.&rdquo; So Ellis observes of Polynesians generally that
      the sacred objects might be either mere stocks and stones, or carved
      wooden images, from six to eight feet long down to as many inches. Some of
      these were to represent &ldquo;tu,&rdquo; divine manes or spirits of the
      dead; while others were to represent &ldquo;tu,&rdquo; or deities of
      higher rank and power. To my mind, this is almost a distinction without a
      difference; the first being ghosts of recently deceased ancestors, the
      second ghosts of remoter progenitors. The ancient Araucanians again fixed
      over a tomb an upright log, &ldquo;rudely carved to represent the human
      frame.&rdquo; After the death of New Zealand chiefs, wooden images, 20 to
      40 feet high, were erected as monuments. I might easily multiply
      instances; but I refrain lest the list grow tedious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Codrington notes that the large mouths and lolling tongues of many New
      Zealand and Polynesian gods are due to the habit of smearing the mouth
      with blood and other offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where men preserve the corpses of their dead, images are not so likely to
      grow up; but where fear of the dead has brought about the practice of
      burial or burning, it is reasonable that the feelings of affection which
      prompted gifts and endearments to the mummy in the first stage of thought
      should seek some similar material outlet under the altered circumstances.
      Among ourselves, a photograph, a portrait, the toys of a dead child, are
      preserved and cherished. Among savages, ruder representations become
      necessary. They bury the actual corpse safely out of sight, but make some
      rough wooden imitation to represent <span class="pagenum">133</span><a
      name="link133" id="link133"></a>it. Thus it does not surprise us to find
      that while the Marianne Islanders keep the dried bodies of their dead
      ancestors in their huts as household gods, and expect them to give oracles
      out of their skulls, the New Zealanders, on the other hand, &ldquo;set up
      memorial idols of deceased persons near the burial-place, talking
      affectionately to them as if still alive, and casting garments to them
      when they pass by,&rdquo; while they also &ldquo;preserve in their houses
      small carved wooden images, each dedicated to the spirit of an ancestor.&rdquo;
      The Coast Negroes &ldquo;place several earthen images on the graves.&rdquo;
      Some Papuans, &ldquo;after a grave is filled up, collect round an idol,
      and offer provisions to it.&rdquo; The Javans dress up an image in the
      clothes of the deceased. So, too, of the Caribs of the West Indies, we
      learn that they &ldquo;carved little images in the shape in which they
      believed spirits to have appeared to them; and some human figures bore the
      names of ancestors in memory of them.&rdquo; From such little images,
      obviously substituted for the dead body which used once to be preserved
      and affectionately tended, are derived, I believe, most of the household
      gods of the world&mdash;the Lares and Penates of the Romans, the huacas of
      the Peruvians, the teraphim of the Semites.
    </p>
    <p>
      How absolutely image and ancestor are identified we can see among the
      Tenimber Islanders, with whom &ldquo;the <i>matmate</i> are the spirits of
      their ancestors which are worshipped as guardian spirits or household
      gods. They are supposed to enter the house through an opening in the roof,
      and to take up their abode temporarily in the skulls, or in images of wood
      or ivory, in order to partake of the offerings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more facts in the same direction may help to bring out in still
      stronger relief this close equivalence of the corpse and the image. A New
      Guinea mother keeps the mummied body of her child, and carries it about
      with her; whereas a West African mother, living in a tribe where terror of
      the dead has induced the practice of burial, makes <span class="pagenum">134</span><a
      name="link134" id="link134"></a>a little image of her lost darling out of
      a gourd or calabash, wraps it in skins, and feeds it or puts it to sleep
      like a living baby. Bastian saw Indian women in Peru, who had lost an
      infant, carrying about on their backs a wooden doll to represent it. At a
      somewhat higher level, &ldquo;the spiritual beings of the Algonquins,&rdquo;
      says Dr. Tylor, to whom I owe not a few of these instances, &ldquo;were
      represented by, and in language completely identified with, the carved
      wooden heads&rdquo; (note this point) &ldquo;or more complete images, to
      which worship and sacrifice were offered.&rdquo; In all these instances we
      see clearly, I think, the course of the genesis of household deities. In
      Siam, the ashes of the dead are similarly moulded into Buddhist images,
      which are afterwards worshipped as household gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Herbert Spencer has collected several interesting examples some of
      which I will borrow, as showing incidentally how much the growth of the
      idol or image depends upon such abstraction of the real body for burial or
      its equivalent. While a deceased king of Congo is being embalmed, a figure
      is set up in the palace to represent him, and is daily furnished with meat
      and drink. When Charles VI. of France was buried, &ldquo;over the coffin
      was an image of the late king, bearing a rich crown of gold and diamonds,
      and holding two shields.... This image was dressed with cloth of gold....
      In this state was he solemnly carried to the church of Notre Dame.&rdquo;
      Madame de Motteville says of the father of the great Condé, &ldquo;The
      effigy of this prince was waited upon for three days, as was customary&rdquo;&mdash;forty
      days having been the original time during which food was supplied to such
      effigies at the usual hours. Monstrelet describes a like figure used at
      the burial of Henry V. of England: and the Westminster Abbey images
      already noticed belong to the same category.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the case of sacred stones, once more, I am quite ready to admit that
      when once the sanctity of certain stakes or wooden poles came to be
      generally recognised, it <span class="pagenum">135</span><a name="link135"
      id="link135"></a>would be a simple transference of feeling to suppose that
      any stake, arbitrarily set up, might become the shrine or home of an
      indwelling spirit. Thus we are told that the Brazilian tribes &ldquo;set
      up stakes in the ground, and make offerings before them to appease their
      deities or demons.&rdquo; So also we are assured that among the Dinkas of
      the White Nile, &ldquo;the missionaries saw an old woman in her hut
      offering the first of her food before a short thick staff planted in the
      ground.&rdquo; But in neither of these cases is there necessarily anything
      to show that the spot where the staff was set up was not a place of
      burial; while in the second instance this is even probable, as hut
      interments are extremely common in Africa. I will quote one other instance
      only, for its illustrative value in a subsequent connexion. In the Society
      Islands, rude logs are clothed in native cloth (like Monigan&rsquo;s idol)
      and anointed with oil, receiving adoration and sacrifice as the
      dwelling-place of a deity. This custom is parallel to that of the Caribs,
      who took a bone of a dead friend from the grave, wrapped it up in cotton,
      and enquired of it for oracles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Savage Landor, in his interesting work <i>The Hairy Ainu</i>, figures
      and describes some curious grave-stakes of those Japanese aborigines. The
      stakes on the men&rsquo;s graves are provided with a phallic protuberance;
      those on the women&rsquo;s with an equally phallic perforation. This fact
      helps to illustrate the phallicism of sacred stones in Syria and
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Semitic peoples, always specially interesting to us from their
      genetic connexion with Judaism and Christianity, the worship of stakes
      usually took the form of adoration paid to the curious log of wood
      described as an <i>ashera</i>. What kind of object an <i>ashera</i> was we
      learn from the injunction in Deuteronomy, &ldquo;Thou shalt not plant an
      <i>ashera</i> of any kind of wood beside the altar of Jahweh.&rdquo; This
      prohibition is clearly parallel to that against any hewn stone or &ldquo;graven
      image.&rdquo; But the Semites in general worshipped as a rule at a rude
      stone altar, <span class="pagenum">136</span><a name="link136" id="link136"></a>beside
      which stood an <i>ashera</i>, under a green tree,&mdash;all three of the
      great sacred objects of humanity being thus present together. A similar
      combination is not uncommon in India, where sacred stone and wooden image
      stand often under the shade of the same holy peepul tree. &ldquo;The <i>ashera</i>,&rdquo;
      says Professor Robertson Smith, &ldquo;is a sacred symbol, the seat of the
      deity, and perhaps the name itself, as G. Hoffmann has suggested, means
      nothing more than the &lsquo;mark&rsquo; of the divine presence.&rdquo;
      Those who have followed me so far in the present work, however, will be
      more likely to conclude that it meant originally the mark of a place where
      an ancestor lay buried. &ldquo;Every altar,&rdquo; says Professor Smith,
      again, &ldquo;had its <i>ashera</i>, even such altars as in the popular
      preprophetic forms of the Hebrew religion were dedicated to Jehovah.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Semitic sacred pole was treated in most respects like the other
      grave-stakes and idols we have hitherto considered; for an Assyrian
      monument from Khorsabad, figured by Rawlinson, represents an ornamental
      pole, planted beside an altar; priests stand before it engaged in an act
      of worship, and touch the pole with their hands, &ldquo;or perhaps,&rdquo;
      says Professor Smith, &ldquo;anoint it with some liquid substance.&rdquo;
      That the <i>ashera</i> was also draped, like the logs of the Society
      Islanders, or Monigan&rsquo;s Irish idol, we learn from the famous passage
      in Second Kings (xxiii. 7) where it is said that the women &ldquo;wove <i>hangings</i>
      for the <i>ashera</i>.&rdquo; Dr. Robertson Smith illustrates this passage
      by the parallel of the sacred <i>erica</i> at Byblus, which was &ldquo;a
      mere dead stump, for it was cut down by Isis and presented to the Byblians
      wrapped in a linen cloth and anointed with myrrh like a corpse. It
      therefore represented the dead god&rdquo; (Osiris, or rather in its origin
      Adonis). &ldquo;But as a mere stump, it also resembles the Hebrew <i>ashera</i>.&rdquo;
      So near may a man come to the perception of a truth, and yet so utterly
      may he miss its actual import.

      I will dwell no longer upon these more or less remote derivatives of the
      grave-stake. I will only say briefly that in <span class="pagenum">137</span><a
      name="link137" id="link137"></a>my opinion all wooden idols or images are
      directly or indirectly descended from the wooden headpost or still more
      primitive sepulchral pole. Not of course that I suppose every wooden image
      to have been necessarily once itself a funereal monument. Donatello&rsquo;s
      Magdalen in San Giovanni at Florence, the blue-robed and star-spangled
      Madonna of the wayside shrine, have certainly no such immediate origin.
      But I do believe that the habit of making and worshipping wooden images
      arose in the way I have pointed out; and to those who would accuse me of
      &ldquo;gross Euhemerism,&rdquo; I would once more remark that even in
      these highest Christian instances the objects of veneration are themselves
      in the last resort admitted to have been at one time Galilean women. Nay,
      is not even the wayside shrine itself in most Catholic countries more
      often than not the mortuary chapel erected where some wayfarer has died a
      violent death, by murder, lightning, accident, or avalanche?

      class="pagenum">138</span><a name="link138" id="link138"></a>sacred tree
      stands less obviously in the direct line of ancestry of gods and of God
      than the sacred stone and the sacred stake which we have just considered.
      I would willingly pass it over, therefore, in this long preliminary
      inquisition, could I safely do so, in order to progress at once to the
      specific consideration of the God of Israel and the rise of Monotheism.
      But the tree is nevertheless so closely linked with the two other main
      objects of human worship that I hardly see how I can avoid considering it
      here in the same connexion: especially as in the end it has important
      implications with regard to the tree of the cross, as well as to the True
      Vine, and many other elements of Christian faith and Christian symbolism.
      I shall therefore give it a short chapter as I pass, premising that I have
      already entered into the subject at greater length in my excursus On the
      Origin of Tree-Worship, appended to my verse translation of the <i>Attis</i>
      of Catullus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worship of sacred trees is almost as widely diffused over the whole
      world as the worship of dead bodies, mummies, relics, graves, sacred
      stones, sacred stakes, and stone or wooden idols. The great authorities on
      the subject of Tree-Worship are Mannhardt&rsquo;s <i>Baumkultus</i> and
      Mr. J. G. Frazer&rsquo;s <i>The Golden Bough</i>. Neither of those learned
      and acute writers, however, has fully seen the true origin of worship from
      funeral practices: and therefore it becomes necessary to go over the same
      ground again briefly here from the point of view afforded us by the
      corpse-theory and <span class="pagenum">139</span><a name="link139"
      id="link139"></a>ghost-theory of the basis of religion. I shall hope to
      add something to their valuable results, and also incidentally to show
      that all the main objects of worship together leads us back unanimously to
      the Cult of the Dead as their common starting-point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us begin in this instance (contrary to our previous practice) by
      examining and endeavouring to understand a few cases of the behaviour of
      tree-spirits in various mythologies. Virgil tells us in the Third Æneid
      how, on a certain occasion, Æneas was offering a sacrifice on a tumulus
      crowned with dogwood and myrtle bushes. He endeavoured to pluck up some of
      these by the roots, in order to cover the altar, as was customary, with
      leaf-clad branches. As he did so, the first bush which he tore up
      astonished him by exuding drops of liquid blood, which trickled and fell
      upon the soil beneath. He tried again, and again the tree bled human gore.
      On the third trial, a groan was heard proceeding from the tumulus, and a
      voice assured Æneas that the barrow on which he stood covered the murdered
      remains of his friend Polydorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in this typical and highly illustrative myth&mdash;no doubt an
      ancient and well-known story incorporated by Virgil in his great poem&mdash;we
      see that the tree which grows upon a barrow is itself regarded as the
      representative and embodiment of the dead man&rsquo;s soul, just as
      elsewhere the snake which glides from the tomb of Anchises is regarded as
      the embodied spirit of the hero, and just as the owls and bats which haunt
      sepulchral caves are often identified in all parts of the world with the
      souls of the departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar stories of bleeding or speaking trees or bushes occur abundantly
      elsewhere. &ldquo;When the oak is being felled,&rdquo; says Aubrey, in his
      <i>Remains of Gentilisme</i>, &ldquo;it gives a kind of shriekes and
      groanes that may be heard a mile off, as if it were the genius of the oak
      lamenting. E. Wyld, Esq., hath heared it severall times.&rdquo; Certain
      Indians, says Bastian, dare not cut a particular plant, because there
      comes out of it a red juice which they take for its blood. <span
      class="pagenum">140</span><a name="link140" id="link140"></a>I myself
      remember hearing as a boy in Canada that wherever <i>Sanguinaria
      Canadensis</i>, the common American bloodroot, grew in the woods, an
      Indian had once been buried, and that the red drops of juice which exuded
      from the stem when one picked the flowers were the dead man&rsquo;s blood.
      In Samoa, says Mr. Turner, the special abode of Tuifiti, King of Fiji, was
      a grove of large and durable afzelia trees. &ldquo;No one dared cut that
      timber. A story is told of a party from Upolu who once attempted it, and
      the consequence was that blood flowed from the tree, and that the
      sacrilegious strangers all took ill and died.&rdquo; Till 1855, says
      Mannhardt, there was a sacred larch-tree at Nauders in the Tyrol, which
      was thought to bleed whenever it was cut. In some of these cases, it is
      true, we do not actually know that the trees grew on tumuli, but this
      point is specially noticed about Polydorus&rsquo;s dogwood, and is
      probably implied in the Samoan case, as I gather from the title given to
      the spirit as king of Fiji.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other instances, however, such a doubt does not exist. We are expressly
      told that it is the souls of the dead which are believed to animate the
      speaking or bleeding trees. &ldquo;The Dieyerie tribe of South Australia,&rdquo;
      says Mr. Frazer, &ldquo;regard as very sacred certain trees which are
      supposed to be their fathers transformed; hence they will not cut the
      trees down, and protest against settlers doing so.&rdquo; Some of the
      Philippine Islanders believe that the souls of their forefathers inhabit
      certain trees, which they therefore spare. If obliged to fell one of these
      sacred trunks, they excuse themselves by saying that it was the priests
      who made them fell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, how did this connexion between the tree and the ghost or ancestor
      grow up? In much the same way, I imagine, as the connexion between the
      sacred stone or the sacred stake and the dead chief who lies buried
      beneath it. Whatever grows or stands upon the grave is sure to share the
      honours paid to the spirit that dwells within it. Thus a snake or other
      animal seen to glide out of a tomb is <span class="pagenum">141</span><a
      name="link141" id="link141"></a>instantly taken by savages and even by
      half-civilised men as the genius or representative of the dead inhabitant.
      But do trees grow out of graves? Undoubtedly, yes. In the first place,
      they may grow by mere accident, as they might grow anywhere else; the more
      so as the soil in such a case has been turned and laboured. But beyond
      this, in the second place, it is common all over the world to plant trees
      or shrubs over the graves of relatives or tribesmen. Though direct
      evidence on this point is difficult to obtain, a little is forthcoming. In
      Algeria, I observed, the Arab women went on Fridays to plant flowers and
      shrubs on the graves of their immediate dead. I learned from Mr. R. L.
      Stevenson that similar plantings take place in Samoa and Fiji. The
      Tahitians put young casuarinas on graves. In Roman Catholic countries the
      planting of shrubs in cemeteries takes place usually on the <i>jour des
      morts</i>, a custom which would argue for it an immense antiquity; for
      though it is a point of honour among Catholics to explain this <i>fete</i>
      as of comparatively recent origin, definitely introduced by a particular
      saint at a particular period, its analogy to similar celebrations
      elsewhere shows us that it is really a surviving relic of a very ancient
      form of Manesworship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Græco-Roman antiquity it is certain that trees were frequently planted
      around the barrows of the dead; and that leafy branches formed part of the
      established ceremonial of funerals. I cannot do better than quote in this
      respect once more the case of Polydorus:=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergo
      instauramus Polydoro funus, et ingens
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggeritur
      tumulo tellus; stant Manibus aræ,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cæruleis
      mostæ vittis atraque cupresso.=
    </p>
    <p>
      Suetonius again tells us how the tumulus of the divine Augustus was
      carefully planted; and the manner in which he notes the fact seems to me
      to argue that some special importance was attached to the ceremony. The
      acacia is one of the most sacred trees of Egypt; and Egyptian monuments,
      with their usual frankness, show us a sarcophagus <span class="pagenum">142</span><a
      name="link142" id="link142"></a>from which an acacia emerges, with the
      naïve motto, &ldquo;Osiris springs forth.&rdquo;,
    </p>
    <p>
      An incident which occurred during the recent Sino-Japanese war shows how
      easily points of this sort may be overlooked by hasty writers in formal
      descriptions. One of the London illustrated papers printed an account of
      the burial of the Japanese dead at Port Arthur, and after mentioning the
      simple headstone erected at each grave volunteered the further statement
      that nothing else marked the place of interment. But the engraving which
      accompanied it, taken from a photograph, showed on the contrary that a
      little tree had also been planted on each tiny tumulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learn from Mr. William Simpson that the Tombs of the Kings near Pekin
      are conspicuous from afar by their lofty groves of pine trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evergreens, I believe, are specially planted upon graves or tumuli because
      they retain their greenness throughout the entire winter, and thus as it
      were give continuous evidence of the vitality and activity of the
      indwelling spirit. Mr. Frazer has shown in <i>The Golden Bough</i> that
      mistletoe similarly owes its special sanctity to the fact that it visibly
      holds the soul of the tree uninjured in itself, while all the surrounding
      branches stand bare and lifeless. Accordingly, tumuli are very frequently
      crowned by evergreens. Almost all the round barrows in southern England,
      for example, are topped by very ancient Scotch firs; and as the Scotch fir
      is not an indigenous tree south of the Tweed, it is practically certain
      that these old pines are the descendants of ancestors put in by human
      hands when the barrows were first raised over the cremated and buried
      bodies of prehistoric chieftains. In short, the Scotch fir is in England
      the sacred tree of the barrows. As a rule, however, in Northern Europe,
      the yew is the species specially planted in graveyards, and several such
      yews in various parts of England and Germany are held to possess a
      peculiar sanctity. The great clump of very ancient yews in <span
      class="pagenum">143</span><a name="link143" id="link143"></a>Norbury Park
      near Dorking, known as the Druids&rsquo; Grove, has long been considered a
      holy wood of remote antiquity. In southern Europe, the cypress replaces
      the yew as the evergreen most closely connected with tombs and cemeteries.
      In Provence and Italy, however, the evergreen holme-oak is almost equally
      a conventional denizen of places of interment. M. Lajard in his able essay
      <i>Sur le Culte du Cypres</i> has brought together much evidence of this
      worship of evergreens, among the Greeks, Etruscans, Romans, Phoenicians,
      Arabs, Persians, Hindus, Chinese, and American nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacred trees, especially when standing alone, are treated in many respects
      with the same ceremonial as is employed towards dead bodies, mummies,
      graves, sacred stones, sacred stakes, and carved idols or statues. In
      other words, the offerings to the ghost or god may be made to the tree
      that grows on the grave just as well as to any other of the recognised
      embodiments of the indwelling spirit. Darwin in the <i>Voyage of the
      Beagle</i> describes how the Indians of South America would greet with
      loud shouts some sacred tree, standing solitary on some high part of the
      Pampas; libations of brandy and maté were poured into a hole at its base
      to gratify the soul of the deity who dwelt there. One of these tree-gods
      had a name, Walleechu. The Congo people, again, put calabashes of
      palm-wine at the foot of &ldquo;trees treated as idols.&rdquo; In other
      cases, blood is smeared on the tree; or oil is offered to it. Mr. Duff
      Macdonald&rsquo;s Central Africans kill chickens at the foot of the
      &ldquo;prayer tree,&rdquo; and let its blood trickle down to the roots.
      Oldfield saw at Addacoodah fowls and many other articles of food suspended
      as offerings to a gigantic tree. Sir William Hunter mentions that once a
      year at Beerbhoom the Santals &ldquo;make simple offerings to a ghost who
      dwells in a Bela tree.&rdquo; In Tonga, the natives lay presents of food
      at the foot of particular trees which they believe to be inhabited by
      spirits. I need not multiply <span class="pagenum">144</span><a
      name="link144" id="link144"></a>instances; they may be found by the
      hundred in Dr. Tylor and other great anthropological collections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the sacred tree is found in the closest possible connection
      with the other indubitably ancestral monuments, the sacred stone and the
      idol. &ldquo;A Bengal village,&rdquo; says Sir William Hunter, &ldquo;has
      usually its local god, which it adores either in the form of a rude unhewn
      stone, or a stump, or a tree marked with red lead&rdquo;; the last being
      probably a substitute for the blood of human or animal victims with which
      it was once watered. &ldquo;Sometimes a lump of clay placed under a tree
      does duty for a deity; and the attendant priest, when there is one,
      generally belongs to one of the half-Hinduised low castes. The rude stone
      represents the non-Aryan fetish; and the tree seems to owe its sanctity to
      the non-Aryan belief that it forms the abode of the ghosts or gods of the
      village.&rdquo; That is to say, we have here ancestor-worship in its
      undisguised early native development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may mention here in brief that, as we shall hereafter see, this triple
      combination of stone, log, and tree forms almost the normal or invariable
      composition of the primitive shrine the whole world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The association of the sacred tree with actual idols or images of deceased
      ancestors is well seen in the following passage which I quote from Dr.
      Tylor: &ldquo;A clump of larches on a Siberian steppe, a grove in the
      recesses of a forest, is the sanctuary of a Turanian tribe. Gaily-decked
      idols in their warm fur coats, each set up beneath its great tree swathed
      with cloth or tinplate, endless reindeer-hides and peltry hanging to the
      trees around, kettles and spoons and snuff-horns and household valuables
      strewn as offerings before the gods&mdash;such is the description of a
      Siberian holy grove, at the stage when the contact of foreign civilisation
      has begun by ornamenting the rude old ceremonial it must end by
      abolishing. A race ethnologically allied to these tribes, though risen to
      higher culture, kept up remarkable relics of tree-worship in Northern
      Europe. In <span class="pagenum">145</span><a name="link145" id="link145"></a>Esthonian
      districts, within the present century, the traveller might often see the
      sacred tree, generally an ancient lime, oak, or ash, standing inviolate in
      a sheltered spot near the dwelling-house; and the old memories are handed
      down of the time when the first blood of a slaughtered beast was sprinkled
      on its roots, that the cattle might prosper, or when an offering was laid
      beneath the holy linden, on the stone where the worshipper knelt on his
      bare knees, moving from east to west and back, which stone he kissed when
      he had said, &lsquo;Receive the food as an offering.&lsquo;&rdquo; After
      the evidence already given, I do not think there can be a reasonable
      doubt, in such a combination of tree and stone, that we have here a
      sacrifice to an ancestral spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, in the courtyard of a Bodo house is planted the sacred
      euphorbia of Batho, the national god, to which a priest offers prayer and
      kills a pig. In the island of Tjumba, in the East Indies, a festival is
      held after harvest, and vessels are filled with rice as a thank-offering
      to the gods. Then the sacred stone at the foot of a palm tree is sprinkled
      with the blood of a sacrificed animal, and rice is laid on the stone for
      the gods. When the Khonds settle a new village, a sacred cotton tree must
      be planted with solemn rites, and beneath it is placed the sacrificial
      stone which embodies or represents the village deity. Among the Semites,
      says Professor Robertson Smith, &ldquo;no Canaanite high place was
      complete without its sacred tree standing beside the altar.&rdquo; We
      shall only fully understand the importance of these facts, however, when
      we come later to consider the subject of the manufacture of gods by
      deliberate process, and the nature of the bloody ceremonial which always
      accompanies it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some of the above instances it is incidentally mentioned that the
      trunks of sacred trees are occasionally draped, as we saw to be also the
      case with sacred stones, sacred stakes, idols, and relics. Another example
      of this practice is given in the account of the holy oak of Romowe,
      venerated <span class="pagenum">146</span><a name="link146" id="link146"></a>by
      the ancient Prussians, which was hung with drapery like the <i>ashera</i>,
      and decked with little hanging images of the gods. The holy trees of
      Ireland are still covered with rag offerings. Other cases will be noticed
      in other connexions hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, just as stones come to be regarded as ancestors, so by a like
      process do sacred trees. Thus Galton says in South Africa, &ldquo;We
      passed a magnificent tree. It was the parent of all the Damaras.... The
      savages danced round it in great delight.&rdquo; Several Indian tribes
      believe themselves to be the sons of trees. Many other cases are noted by
      Mr. Herbert Spencer and Dr. Tylor. I do not think it is necessary for our
      argument to repeat them here. Sometimes, however, especially in later
      rationalising times, the sacred tree is merely said to have been planted
      by the god or hero whom it commemorates. Thus the cypresses of Herakles at
      Daphne were believed to have been set on the spot by that deity, while the
      tamarisk at Beersheba was supposed to have been placed there by Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope it is clear from this rapid <i>resume</i> that all the facts about
      the worship of sacred trees stand exactly parallel to those with regard to
      the worship of graves, mummies, idols, sacred stones, sacred stakes, and
      other signs of departed spirits. Indeed, we have sometimes direct evidence
      of such affiliation. Thus Mr. Turner says of a sacred tree on a certain
      spot in the island of Savaii, which enjoyed rights of sanctuary like the
      cities of refuge or a mediæval cathedral: &ldquo;It is said that the king
      of a division of Upolu, called Atua, once lived at that spot. After he
      died, the house fell into decay; but the tree was fixed on as representing
      the departed king, and out of respect for his memory it was made the
      substitute of a living and royal protector.&rdquo; By the light of this
      remark we may surely interpret in a similar sense such other statements of
      Mr. Turner&rsquo;s as that a sweet-scented tree in another place &ldquo;was
      held to be the habitat of a household god, and anything aromatic <span
      class="pagenum">147</span><a name="link147" id="link147"></a>which the
      family happened to get was presented to it as an offering;&rdquo; or
      again, &ldquo;a family god was supposed to live&rdquo; in another tree;
      &ldquo;and hence no one dared to pluck a leaf or break a branch.&rdquo;
      For family gods, as we saw in a previous chapter, are really family
      ghosts, promoted to be deities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In modern accounts of sacred trees much stress is usually laid upon the
      fact that they are large and well-grown, often very conspicuous, and
      occupying a height, where they serve as landmarks. Hence it has frequently
      been taken for granted that they have been selected for worship on account
      of their size and commanding position. This, however, I think, is a case
      of putting the cart before the horse, as though one were to say that St.
      Peter&rsquo;s and Westminster Abbey, the Temple of Karnak or the Mosque of
      Omar, owed their sanctity to their imposing dimensions. There is every
      reason why a sacred tree should grow to be exceptionally large and
      conspicuous. Barrows are usually built on more or less commanding heights,
      where they may attract general attention. The ground is laboured, piled
      high, freed from weeds, and enriched by blood and other offerings. The
      tree, being sacred, is tended and cared for. It is never cut down, and so
      naturally on the average of instances grows to be a big and well-developed
      specimen. Hence I hold the tree is usually big because it is sacred, not
      sacred because it is big. On the other hand, where a tree already
      full-grown is chosen for a place of burial, it would no doubt be natural
      to choose a large and conspicuous one. Thus I read of the tree under which
      Dr. Livingstone&rsquo;s heart was buried by his native servant, &ldquo;It
      is the largest in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the question broadly, the case stands thus. We know that in
      many instances savages inter their dead under the shade of big trees. We
      know that such trees are thereafter considered sacred, and worshipped with
      blood, clothes, drapery, offerings. We know that young shrubs <span
      class="pagenum">148</span><a name="link148" id="link148"></a>or trees are
      frequently planted on graves in all countries. We know that whatever comes
      up on or out of a grave is counted as representative of the ghost within
      it. The presumption is therefore in favour of any particular sacred tree
      being of funereal origin; and the onus of proving the opposite lies with
      the person who asserts some more occult and less obvious explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time I am quite ready to allow here, as in previous instances,
      when once the idea of certain trees being sacred has grown common among
      men, many trees may come to possess by pure association a sanctity of
      their own. This is doubtless the case in India with the peepul, and in
      various other countries with various other trees. Exactly the same thing
      has happened to stones. And so, again, though I believe the temple to have
      been developed out of the tomb or its covering, I do not deny that
      churches are now built apart from tombs, though always dedicated to the
      worship of a God who is demonstrably a particular deified personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another point on which I must touch briefly is that of the sacred grove or
      cluster of trees. These often represent, I take it, the trees planted in
      the <i>temenos</i> or sacred tabooed space which surrounds the primitive
      tomb or temple. The <i>koubbas</i> or little dome-shaped tombs of
      Mahommedan saints so common in North Africa are all surrounded by such a
      walled enclosure, within which ornamental or other trees are habitually
      planted. In many cases these are palms&mdash;the familiar sacred tree of
      Mesopotamia, about which more must be said hereafter in a later chapter.
      The well-known <i>bois sacré</i> at Blidah is a considerable grove, with a
      <i>koubba</i> in its midst. A similar <i>temenos</i> frequently surrounded
      the Egyptian and the Greek temple. I do not assert that these were always
      of necessity actual tombs; but they were at any rate cenotaphs. When once
      people had got accustomed to the idea that certain trees were sacred to
      the memory of their ancestors or their gods, it would be but a slight step
      to plant such trees <span class="pagenum">149</span><a name="link149"
      id="link149"></a>round an empty temple. When Xenophon, for example, built
      a shrine to Artemis, and planted around it a grove of many kinds of fruit
      trees, and placed in it an altar and an image of the goddess, nobody would
      for a moment suppose he erected it over the body of an actual dead
      Artemis. But men would never have begun building temples and consecrating
      groves at all if they had not first built houses for the dead god-chief,
      and planted shrubs and trees upon his venerated tumulus. Nay, even the
      naïve inscription upon Xenophon&rsquo;s shrine&mdash;&ldquo;He who lives
      here and enjoys the fruits of the ground must every year offer the tenth
      part of the produce to the goddess, and out of the residue keep the temple
      in repair&rdquo;&mdash;does it not carry us back implicitly to the origin
      of priesthood, and of the desire for perpetuity in the due maintenance of
      the religious offices?
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall say nothing here about the evolution of the great civilised
      tree-gods like Attis and Adonis, so common in the region of the eastern
      Mediterranean, partly because I have already treated them at some length
      in the essay on Tree-Worship to which I have alluded above, and partly
      because they would lead us too far afield from our present subject. But a
      few words must be devoted in passing to the prevalence of tree-worship
      among the Semitic peoples, intimately connected as it is with the rise of
      certain important elements in the Christian cult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all parts of the Semitic area,&rdquo; says Professor Robertson
      Smith, &ldquo;trees were adored as divine.&rdquo; Among the species thus
      honoured he enumerates especially the pines and cedars of Lebanon, the
      evergreen oaks of the Palestinian hills, the tamarisks of the Syrian
      jungles, and the acacias of the Arabian wadies. Most of these, it will be
      noted, are evergreens. In Arabia, the most striking case on record is that
      of the sacred date-palm at Nejran. This was adored at an annual feast,
      when it was &ldquo;all hung with fine clothes and women&rsquo;s ornaments.&rdquo;
      A similar tree existed at Mecca, to which the people resorted annually,
      <span class="pagenum">150</span><a name="link150" id="link150"></a>and
      hung upon it weapons, garments, ostrich eggs, and other offerings. In a
      sacred acacia at Nakla a goddess was supposed to live. The modern Arabs
      still hang pieces of flesh on such sacred trees, honour them with
      sacrifices, and present them with rags of calico and coloured beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the Phoenicians and Canaanites, Philo Byblius says that plants
      were in ancient times revered as gods, and honoured with libations and
      sacrifices. Dr. Robertson Smith gives several instances. Christianity has
      not extinguished the veneration for sacred trees in Syria, where they are
      still prayed to in sickness and hung with rags. The Moslems of Palestine
      also venerate the sacred trees of immemorial antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Hebrew scriptures tree-worship constantly appears, and is frankly
      dwelt with by Professor Robertson Smith, who does not refuse to connect
      with this set of beliefs the legend of Jahweh in the burning bush. The
      local altars of early Hebrew cult were habitually set up &ldquo;under
      green trees.&rdquo; On this subject I would refer the reader to Dr. Smith&rsquo;s
      own interesting disquisition on p. 193 of The Religion of the Semites.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the general sacredness of vegetation, and especially of
      food-plants, such as corn, the vine, and the date-palm, I postpone that
      important subject for the present, till we come to consider the gods of
      cultivation, and the curious set of ideas which gradually led up to
      sacramental god-eating. In a theme so vast and so involved as that of
      human religion, it becomes necessary to take one point at a time, and to
      deal with the various parts in analytic isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now examined briefly almost all the principal sacred objects of
      the world, according to classes&mdash;the corpse, the mummy, the idol, the
      sacred stone, the sacred stake, the sacred tree or grove; there remains
      but one other group of holy things, very generally recognised, which I do
      not propose to examine separately, but to which <span class="pagenum">151</span><a
      name="link151" id="link151"></a>a few words may yet be devoted at the end
      of a chapter. I mean, the sacred wells. It might seem at first sight as if
      these could have no possible connection with death or burial; but that
      expectation is, strange to say, delusive. There appears to be some reason
      for bringing wells, too, into the widening category of funereal objects.
      The oxen&rsquo;s well at Acre, for example, was visited by Christian,
      Jewish, and Moslem pilgrims; it was therefore an object of great ancient
      sanctity; but observe this point: there is a <i>mashhed</i> or sacred tomb
      beside it, &ldquo;perhaps the modern representative of the ancient
      Memnonium.&rdquo; Every Egyptian temple had in like manner its sacred
      lake. In modern Syria, &ldquo;cisterns are always found beside the grave
      of saints, and are believed to be inhabited by a sort of fairy. A pining
      child is thought to be a fairy changeling, and must be lowered into the
      cistern.&rdquo; The similarity of the belief about holy wells in England
      and Ireland, and their frequent association with the name of a saint,
      would seem to suggest for them a like origin. Sacred rivers usually rise
      from sacred springs, near which stands a temple. The river Adonis took its
      origin at the shrine of Aphaca: and the grave of Adonis, about whom much
      more must be said hereafter, stood near the mouth of the holy stream that
      was reddened by his blood. The sacred river Belus had also its peculiar
      Memnonium or Adonis tomb. But I must add that sacred rivers had likewise
      their annual god-victims, about whom we shall have a great deal to say at
      a later stage of our enquiry, and from whom in part they probably derived
      their sanctity. Still, that their holiness was also due in part, and
      originally, to tombs at their sources, I think admits of no reasonable
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equivalence of the holy well and the holy stone is shown by the fact
      that while a woman whose chastity was suspected had to drink water of a
      sacred spring to prove her innocence, at Mecca she had to swear seventy
      oaths by the Kaaba.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, <span class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152" id="link152"></a>sacred
      wells and fountains were and are worshipped with just the same acts of
      sacrifice as ghosts and images. At Aphaca, the pilgrims cast into the holy
      pool, jewels of gold and silver, with webs of linen and other precious
      stuffs. A holy grove was an adjunct of the holy spring: in Greece,
      according to Botticher, they were seldom separated. At the annual fair of
      the Sacred Terebinth, or tree and well of Abraham at Mamre, the heathen
      visitors offered sacrifices beside the tree, and cast into the well
      libations of wine, with cakes, coins, myrrh, and incense: all of which we
      may compare with the Ostyak offerings to ancestral grave-stakes. At the
      holy waters of Karwa, bread, fruit, and other foods were laid beside the
      fountain. At Mecca, and at the Stygian Waters in the Syrian desert,
      similar gifts were cast into the holy source. In one of these instances at
      least we know that the holy well was associated with an actual burial; for
      at Aphaca, the holiest shrine of Syria, the tomb of the local Baal or god
      was shown beside the sacred fountain. &ldquo;A buried god,&rdquo; says Dr.
      Robertson Smith quaintly, in commenting on this fact, &ldquo;is a god that
      dwells under ground.&rdquo; It would be far truer and more philosophical
      to say that a god who dwells underground is a buried man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not recall the offerings to Cornish and Irish well-spirits, which
      have now degenerated for the most part into pins and needles.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, though it is impossible to understand the entire genesis of
      sacred founts and rivers without previous consideration of deliberate
      god-making, a subject which I reserve for a later portion of our
      exposition, I do not think we shall go far wrong in supposing that the
      sacred well most often occurs in company with the sacred tree, the sacred
      stone or altar, and the sacred tomb; and that it owes its sanctity in the
      last resort, originally at least, to a burial by its side; though I do not
      doubt that this sanctity was in many cases kept up by the annual
      immolation of a fresh victim-god, of a type whose genesis will hereafter
      <span class="pagenum">153</span><a name="link153" id="link153"></a>detain
      us. Indeed, Dr. Robertson Smith says of the Semitic worship in general,
      &ldquo;The usual natural symbols are a fountain or a tree, while the
      ordinary artificial symbol is a pillar or pile of stones: but very often
      all three are found together, and this was the rule in the more developed
      sanctuaries.&rdquo; I cannot agree with him on the point of &ldquo;symbolism&rdquo;:
      but the collocation of objects is at least significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in ultimate analysis, we see that all the sacred objects of the
      world are either dead men themselves, as corpse, mummy, ghost, or god; or
      else the tomb where such men are buried; or else the temple, shrine, or
      hut which covers the tomb; or else the tombstone, altar, image, or statue,
      standing over it and representing the ghost; or else the stake, idol, or
      household god which is fashioned as their deputy; or else the tree which
      grows above the barrow; or else the well, or tank, or spring, natural or
      artificial, by whose side the dead man has been laid to rest. In one form
      or another, from beginning to end, we find only, in Mr. William Simpson&rsquo;s
      graphic phrase, &ldquo;the Worship of Death,&rdquo; as the basis and root
      of all human religion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;THE GODS OF EGYPT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E <span
      class="pagenum">154</span><a name="link154" id="link154"></a>have now
      completed our preliminary survey of the nature and origin of Gods in
      general. We have seen how men first came to believe in the objective
      existence of these powerful and invisible beings, how they learnt to
      invest them with majestic attributes, and how they grew to worship them
      under the various forms of mummies or boulders, stone or wooden idols,
      trees or stumps, wells, rivers, and fountains. In short, we have briefly
      arrived at the origin of Polytheism. We have now to go on to our second
      question&mdash;How from the belief in many gods did men progress to the
      belief in one single God, the creator and upholder of all things? Our task
      is now to reconstruct the origin of Monotheism.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Monotheism bases itself entirely upon the great God of the Hebrews. To
      him, therefore, we must next address ourselves. Is he too resoluble, as I
      hinted before, into a Sacred Stone, the monument and representative of
      some prehistoric chieftain? Can we trace the origin of the Deity of
      Christendom till we find him at last in a forgotten Semitic ghost of the
      earliest period?
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief Hebrew god Jahweh, when we first catch a passing glimpse of his
      primitive worship by his own people, was but one among a number of
      competing deities, mostly, it would appear, embodied by their votaries in
      the visible form of stone or wooden pillars, and adored by a small group
      of loosely-connected tribes among the mountain region in the southwest of
      Syria. The confederacy among <span class="pagenum">155</span><a
      name="link155" id="link155"></a>whom he dwelt knew themselves as the Sons
      of Israel; they regarded Jahweh as their principal god, much as the Greeks
      did Zeus, or the early Teutons their national hero Woden. But a universal
      tradition among them bore witness to the fact that they had once lived in
      a subject condition in Egypt, the house of bondage, and that their god
      Jahweh had been instrumental in leading them thence into the rugged land
      they inhabited throughout the whole historical period, between the valley
      of Jordan and the Mediterranean coast. So consistent and so definite was
      this traditional belief that we can hardly regard it otherwise than as
      enclosing a kernel of truth; and not only do Kuenen and other Semitic
      scholars of the present day admit it as genuine, but the Egyptologists
      also seem generally to allow its substantial accuracy and full accord with
      hieroglyphic literature. This sojourn in Egypt cannot have failed to
      influence to some extent the Semitic strangers: therefore I shall begin my
      quest of the Hebrew god among the Egyptian monuments. Admitting that he
      was essentially in all respects a deity of the true Semitic pattern, I
      think it will do us good to learn a little beforehand about the people
      among whom his votaries dwelt so long, especially as the history of the
      Egyptian cults affords us perhaps the best historical example of the
      growth and development of a great national religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A peculiar interest, indeed, attaches in the history of the human mind to
      the evolution of the gods of Egypt. Nowhere else in the world can we trace
      so well such a continuous development from the very simplest beginnings of
      religious ideas to the very highest planes of mysticism and philosophic
      theology. There are savage cults, it is true, which show us more clearly
      the earliest stages in the process whereby the simple ancestral ghost
      passes imperceptibly into the more powerful form of a supernatural deity:
      there are elevated civilised creeds which show us more grandly in its
      evolved shape the final conception of a single supreme Ruler of the
      Cosmos. But there is no other <span class="pagenum">156</span><a
      name="link156" id="link156"></a>religious system known to us in which we
      can follow so readily, without a single break, the whole evolutionary
      movement whereby the earlier ideas get gradually expanded and etherealised
      into the later. The origin of the other great historical religions is lost
      from our eyes among dim mists of fable: in Egypt alone, of all civilised
      countries, does our record go back to the remote period when the religious
      conception was still at the common savage level, and follow it forward
      continuously to the advanced point where it had all but achieved, in its
      syncretic movement, the ultimate goal of pure monotheism.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would wish, however, to begin my review of this singular history by
      saying, once for all, that while I make no pretensions to special
      Egyptological knowledge, I must nevertheless dissent on general
      anthropological grounds from the attitude taken up by Mr. Le Page Renouf
      in his <i>Lectures on the Religion of Ancient Egypt</i>. That learned
      writer&rsquo;s work, indeed, is, scientifically speaking, half a century
      behind its time. It is written as though the doctrine of evolution had
      never been promulgated; and every page contains glaring contradictions of
      the most elementary principles of human development. Mr. Renouf still
      adheres to the discredited ideas that polytheism grew out of an antecedent
      monotheism; that animal-worship and other low forms of adoration are
      &ldquo;symbolical&rdquo; in origin; and that &ldquo;the sublimer portions
      of the Egyptian religion are not the comparatively late result of a
      process of development or elimination from the grosser.&rdquo; Such
      theories would of themselves be extremely improbable, even on the fullest
      and best evidence; but the evidence which Mr. Renouf brings forward to
      support them is of the flimsiest description. A plain survey of the
      Egyptian monuments in the Nile valley, and of the known facts about
      Egyptian religion, will lead any unbiassed mind, free from the warping
      influence of preconception, and accustomed to wide anthropological
      enquiry, to precisely opposite and more probable conclusions. For it must
      be carefully borne in mind <span class="pagenum">157</span><a
      name="link157" id="link157"></a>that on these subjects the specialist is
      the last man whose opinions should be implicitly and unhesitatingly
      accepted. The religion of Egypt, like the religion of Judæa or the
      religion of Hawaii, must be judged, not in isolation, but by the analogies
      of other religions elsewhere; the attempt to explain it as an unrelated
      phenomenon, which has already been found so disastrous in the case of the
      Semitic and the Aryan cults, must be abandoned once for all by the
      comparative psychologist as a hopeless error. The key to the origin of the
      Egyptian faith is to be found, not in the late philosophising glosses
      quoted by M. de Rougé and his English disciple, but in the simple,
      unvarying, ancestral creeds of existing African savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looked at from this point of view, then&mdash;the evolutionary point of
      view&mdash;nothing can be clearer than the fact that the early Egyptian
      religion bases itself entirely upon two main foundations, ancestor-worship
      and totemism.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will begin with the first of these, which all analogy teaches us to
      consider by far the earliest, and infinitely the most important. And I may
      add that it is also, to judge by the Egyptian evidence alone, both the
      element which underlies the whole religious conceptions of the Nile
      valley, and likewise the element which directly accounts, as we shall see
      hereafter, for all the most important gods of the national pantheon,
      including Osiris, Ptah, Khem, and Amen, as well perhaps as many of their
      correlative goddesses. There is not, in fact, any great ethnical religion
      on earth, except possibly the Chinese, in which the basal importance of
      the Dead Man is so immediately apparent as in the ancient cult of
      Pharaohnic Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptian religion bases itself upon the tomb. It is impossible for a
      moment to doubt that fact as one stands under the scanty shade of the
      desert date-palms among the huge sun-smitten dust-heaps that represent the
      streets of Thebes and Memphis. The commonest object of worship on all the
      monuments of Nile is beyond doubt the Mummy: sometimes the private mummy
      of an ancestor <span class="pagenum">158</span><a name="link158"
      id="link158"></a>or kinsman, sometimes the greater deified mummies of
      immemorial antiquity, blended in the later syncretic mysticism with the
      sun-god and other allegorical deities, but represented to the very last in
      all ages of art&mdash;on the shattered Rameseum at Thebes or the Ptolemaic
      pillars of still unshaken Denderah&mdash;as always unmistakable and
      obvious mummies. If ever there was a country where the Worship of the Dead
      was pushed to an extreme, that country was distinctly and decisively
      Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The oldest sculptures show us no acts of adoration or of sacrifice,&rdquo;
      says Mr. Loftie, &ldquo;except those of worship at the shrine of a
      deceased ancestor or relative.&rdquo; This is fully in keeping with what
      we know of the dawn of religion elsewhere, and with the immense importance
      always attached to the preservation of the mummy intact throughout the
      whole long course of Egyptian history. The Egyptian, in spite of his high
      civilisation, remained always at the first or corpse-preserving stage of
      custom as regards the dead. To him, therefore, the life after death was
      far more serious than the life on earth: he realised it so fully that he
      made endless preparations for it during his days above, and built himself
      a tomb as an eternal mansion. The grave was a place of abode, where the
      mummy was to pass the greater part of his existence; and even in the case
      of private persons (like that famous Tih whose painted sepulchre at
      Sakkarah every tourist to Cairo makes a point of visiting) it was
      sumptuously decorated with painting and sculpture. In the mortuary
      chambers or chapels attached to the tombs, the relations of the deceased
      and the priests of the cemetery celebrated on certain fixed dates various
      ceremonies in honour of the dead, and offered appropriate gifts to the
      mummy within. &ldquo;The tables of offerings, which no doubt formed part
      of the furniture of the chambers, are depicted on the walls, covered with
      the gifts of meat, fruits, bread, and wine which had to be presented in
      kind.&rdquo; These <i>parentalia</i> undoubtedly formed the main feature
      of the practical religion <span class="pagenum">159</span><a name="link159"
      id="link159"></a>of early Egypt, as exhibited to us on all the monuments
      except the late tomb-caves of royal personages, devoted to the worship of
      the equally mummified great gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptian tomb was usually a survival of the cave artificially
      imitated. The outer chamber, in which the ceremonies of the offertory took
      place, was the only part accessible, after the interment had been
      completed, to the feet of survivors. The mummy itself, concealed in its
      sarcophagus, lay at the bottom of a deep pit beyond, by the end of a
      corridor often containing statues or idols of the deceased. These idols,
      says M. Maspero, were indefinitely multiplied, in case the mummy itself
      should be accidentally destroyed, in order that the <i>Ka</i> (the ghost
      or double) might find a safe dwelling-place. Compare the numerous little
      images placed upon the grave by the Coast Negroes. It was the outer
      chamber, however, that sheltered the <i>stele</i> or pillar which bore the
      epitaph, as well as the altar or table for offerings, the smoke from which
      was conveyed to the statues in the corridor through a small aperture in
      the wall of partition. Down the well beyond, the mummy in person reposed,
      in its eternal dwelling-place, free from all chance of violation or
      outrage. &ldquo;The greatest importance,&rdquo; says Mr. Renouf, &ldquo;was
      attached to the permanence of the tomb, to the continuance of the
      religious ceremonies, and to the prayers of passers-by.&rdquo; Again,
      &ldquo;there is a very common formula stating that the person who raised
      the tablet &lsquo;made it as a memorial to his fathers who are in the
      nether world, built up what he found was imperfect, and renewed what was
      found out of repair.&rsquo;&rdquo; In the inscription on one of the great
      tombs at Beni-Hâssan the founder says: &ldquo;I made to flourish the name
      of my father, and I built chapels for his <i>ka</i> [or ghost]. I caused
      statues to be conveyed to the holy dwelling, and distributed to them their
      offerings in pure gifts. I instituted the officiating priest, to whom I
      gave donations in land and presents. I ordered funeral offerings for all
      the feasts of the nether world [which are then enumerated <span
      class="pagenum">160</span><a name="link160" id="link160"></a>at
      considerable length]. If it happen that the priest or any other cease to
      do this, may he not exist, and may his son not sit in his seat.&rdquo; All
      this is highly instructive from the point of view of the origin of
      priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long these early religious endowments continued to be respected is
      shown by Mr. Renouf himself in one instructive passage. The kings who
      built the Pyramids in the Early Empire endowed a priestly office for the
      purpose of celebrating the periodical rites of offering to their ghosts or
      mummies. Now, a tablet in the Louvre shows that a certain person who lived
      under the Twenty-sixth Dynasty was priest of Khufu, the builder of the
      Great Pyramid, who had endowed the office two thousand years before his
      time. We have actually the tombs of some of his predecessors who filled
      the same office immediately after Khufu&rsquo;s death. So that in this
      instance at least, the worship of the deceased monarch continued for a
      couple of thousand years without interruption. &ldquo;If in the case of
      private interments,&rdquo; says M. Maspero, &ldquo;we find no proof of so
      persistent a veneration, that is because in ordinary tombs the ceremonies
      were performed not by special priests, but by the children or descendants
      of the deceased person. Often, at the end of a few generations, either
      through negligence, removals, ruin, or extinction of the family, the cult
      was suspended, and the memory of the dead died out altogether.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, as everywhere else among ancestor-worshippers, immense
      importance was attached by the Egyptians to the begetting of a son who
      should perform the due family rites, or see that they were performed by
      others after him. The duty of undertaking these rites is thoroughly
      insisted upon in all the maxims or moral texts; while on the other hand,
      the wish that a man may not have a son to perform them for him is the most
      terrible of all ancient Egyptian imprecations. &ldquo;Many centuries after
      the construction of a tomb, Egyptian travellers have left a record upon
      its walls of the splendour of the sacred abode, <span class="pagenum">161</span><a
      name="link161" id="link161"></a>of the abundance of the materials which
      they found provided for the fulfilment of the rites for the departed, and
      of their own repetition of the funeral formula.&rdquo; In fact, the whole
      practical religion of the ordinary Egyptians, as a plain observer sees it
      to-day in the vast mass of the existing monuments, consists almost
      exclusively in the worship of the <i>ka</i>&mdash;the <i>genii, manes, or
      lares</i> of the departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If even the common herd were thus carefully embalmed&mdash;if even the
      lesser functionaries of the court or temple lay in expensive tombs,
      daintily painted and exquisitely sculptured&mdash;it might readily be
      believed that the great kings of the mighty conquering dynasties
      themselves would raise for their mummies eternal habitations of special
      splendour and becoming magnificence. And so they did. In Lower Egypt,
      their tombs are barrows or pyramids: in Upper Egypt they are artificial
      caves. The dreary desert district west of the Nile and south of Cairo
      consists for many miles, all but uninterruptedly, of the cemetery of
      Memphis&mdash;a vast and mouldering city of the dead&mdash;whose chief
      memorials are the wonderful series of Pyramids, the desecrated tombs piled
      up for the kings of the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Dynasties. There,
      under stone tumuli of enormous size,&mdash;barrows or cairns more
      carefully constructed,&mdash;the Pharaohs of the Old Empire reposed, in
      peace in sepulchres unmarked by any emblems of the mystic gods or sacred
      beasts of later imagination. But still more significant and infinitely
      more beautiful are the rock-hewn Tombs of the Kings at Thebes, belonging
      to the great monarchs of the Eighteenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth
      Dynasties, when the religion had assumed its full mystical development.
      Those magnificent subterranean halls form in the truest and most literal
      sense a real necropolis, a town of mummies, where each king was to inhabit
      an eternal palace of regal splendour, decorated with a profusion of
      polychromatic art, and filled with many mansions for the officers <span
      class="pagenum">162</span><a name="link162" id="link162"></a>of state,
      still destined to attend upon their sovereign in the nether world. Some of
      the mural paintings would even seem to suggest that slaves or captives
      were sacrificed at the tomb, to serve their lord in his eternal home, as
      his courtiers had served him in the temporal palaces of Medinet-Hâbu or
      the corridors of Luxor.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Mariette has further shown that the huge Theban temples which skirt in
      long line the edge of the desert near the Valley of Tombs were really
      cenotaphs where the memory of the kings buried hard by was preserved and
      worshipped. Thus the Rameseum was the <i>mastabah</i> or mortuary chapel
      for the tomb and ghost of Rameses II.; the temple of Medinet-Hâbu
      fulfilled the same purpose for Rameses III.; the temple of Kurneh for
      Rameses I.; and so forth throughout the whole long series of those
      gigantic ruins, with their correlated group of subterranean excavations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, it is quite impossible for any impartial person to examine
      the existing monuments which line the grey desert hills of the Nile
      without seeing for himself that the mummy is everywhere the central object
      of worship&mdash;that the entire practical religion of the people was
      based upon this all-pervading sense of the continuity of life beyond the
      grave, and upon the necessity for paying due reverence and funereal
      offerings to the <i>manes</i> of ancestors. Everything in Egypt points to
      this one conclusion. Even the great sacred ritual is the Book of the Dead:
      and the very word by which the departed are oftenest described means
      itself &ldquo;the living,&rdquo; from the firm belief of the people that
      they were really enjoying everlasting life. <i>Mors janua vitae</i> is the
      short summing-up of Egyptian religious notions. Death was the great
      beginning for which they all prepared, and the dead were the real objects
      of their most assiduous oublie and private worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, in the tombs themselves we can trace a gradual development of
      the religious sentiment from Corpse-Worship <span class="pagenum">163</span><a
      name="link163" id="link163"></a>to God-Worship. Thus, in the tombs of
      Sakkarah, belonging to the Old Empire (Fifth Dynasty), all those
      symbolical representations of the life beyond the tomb which came in with
      the later mysticism are almost wholly wanting. The quotations from (or
      anticipations of) the Book of the Dead are few and short. The great gods
      are rarely alluded to. Again, in the grottos of Beni-Hassan (of the
      Twelfth Dynasty) the paintings mostly represent scenes from the life of
      the deceased, and the mystic signs and deities are still absent. The
      doctrine of rewards and punishments remains as yet comparatively in
      abeyance. It is only at the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes (of the
      Eighteenth Dynasty) that entire chapters of the Book of the Dead are
      transcribed at length, and the walls are covered with &ldquo;a whole army
      of grotesque and fantastic divinities.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Egyptians,&rdquo; it will be objected, &ldquo;had also
      great gods, distinct from their ancestors&mdash;national, or local, or
      common gods&mdash;whose names and figures have come down to us inscribed
      upon all the monuments.&rdquo; Quite true: that is to say, there are gods
      who are not immediately or certainly resolvable into deified ancestors&mdash;gods
      whose power and might were at last widely extended, and who became
      transfigured by degrees beyond all recognition in the latest ages. But it
      is by no means certain, even so, that we cannot trace these greater gods
      themselves back in the last resort to deified ancestors of various ruling
      families or dominant cities; and in one or two of the most important cases
      the suggestions of such an origin are far from scanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will take, to begin with, one typical example. There is no single god in
      the Egyptian pantheon more important or more universally diffused than
      Osiris. In later forms of the national religion, he is elevated into the
      judge of the departed and king of the nether world: to be &ldquo;justified
      by Osiris,&rdquo; or, as later interpreters say, &ldquo;a justified
      Osiris,&rdquo; is the prayer of every corpse as set forth in his funeral
      <span class="pagenum">164</span><a name="link164" id="link164"></a>inscription;
      and identification with Osiris is looked upon as the reward of all the
      happy and faithful dead. Now Osiris, in every one of his representations
      and modes, is simply&mdash;a Mummy. His myth, to be sure, assumed at last
      immense proportions; and his relations with Isis and Horus form the centre
      of an endless series of irreconcilable tales, repeated over and over again
      in art and literature. If we took mythology as our guide, instead of the
      monuments, we should be tempted to give him far other origins. He is
      identified often with other gods, especially with Amen; and the
      disentanglement of his personality in the monuments of the newer empire,
      when Ra, the sun-god, got mixed up inextricably with so many other
      deities, is particularly difficult. But if we neglect these later
      complications of a very ancient cult, and go back to the simplest origin
      of Egyptian history and religion, we shall, I think, see that this mystic
      god, so often explained away by elemental symbolism into the sun or the
      home of the dead, was in his first beginnings nothing more or less than
      what all his pictures and statues show him to be&mdash;a revered and
      worshipped Mummy, a very ancient chief or king of the town or little
      district of This by Abydos.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not deny that in later ages Osiris became much more than this. Nor do
      I deny that his name was accepted as a symbol for all the happy and pious
      dead. Furthermore, we shall find at a later stage that he was identified
      in the end with an annual slain Corn-God. I will even allow that there may
      have been more than one original Osiris&mdash;that the word may even at
      first have been generic, not specific. But I still maintain that the
      evidence shows us the great and principal Osiris of all as a Dead Chief of
      Abydos.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must remember that in Egypt alone history goes back to an immense
      antiquity and yet shows us already at its very beginning an advanced
      civilisation and a developed picture-writing. Therefore the very oldest
      known state of Egypt <span class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165"
      id="link165"></a>necessarily presupposes a vast anterior era of slow
      growth in concentration and culture. Before ever Upper or Lower Egypt
      became united under a single crown, there must have been endless mud-built
      villages and petty palm-shadowed principalities along the bank of the
      Nile, each possessing its own local chief or king, and each worshipping
      its own local deceased potentates. The sheikh of the village, as we should
      call him nowadays, was then their nameless Pharaoh, and the mummies of his
      ancestors were their gods and goddesses. Each tribe had also its special
      totem, about which I shall have a little more to say hereafter; and these
      totems were locally worshipped almost as gods, and gave rise in all
      probability to the later Egyptian Zoolatry and the animal-headed deities.
      To the very last, Egyptian religion bore marked traces of this original
      tribal form; the great multiplicity of Egyptian gods seems to be due to
      the adoption of so many of them, after the unification of the country,
      into the national pantheon. The local gods and local totems, however,
      continued to be specially worshipped in their original sites. Thus the
      ithyphallic Amen-Khem was specially worshipped at Thebes, where his figure
      occurs with unpleasant frequency upon every temple; Apis was peculiarly
      sacred at Memphis; Pasht at Bubastis; Anubis at Sekhem; Neith at Sais; Ra
      at Heliopolis; and Osiris himself at Abydos, his ancient dwelling-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Egyptian tradition seems to preserve some dim memory of such a state
      of things, for it asserts that before the time of Menes, the first king of
      the First Dynasty, reputed the earliest monarch of a united Egypt,
      dynasties of the gods ruled in the country. In other words, it was
      recognised that the gods were originally kings of local lines which
      reigned in the various provinces of the Nile valley before the
      unification.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of Osiris, the indications which lead us in this direction are
      almost irresistible. It is all but certain that Osiris was originally a
      local god of This or Thinis, a <span class="pagenum">166</span><a
      name="link166" id="link166"></a>village near Abydos, where a huge mound of
      rubbish still marks the site of the great deity&rsquo;s resting-place. The
      latter town is described in the Harris papyrus as Abud, the hand of
      Osiris; and in the monuments which still remain at that site, Osiris is
      everywhere the chief deity represented, to whom kings and priests present
      appropriate offerings. But it is a significant fact that Menes, the
      founder of the united monarchy, was born at the same place; and this
      suggests the probability that Osiris may have been the most sacred and
      most venerated of Menes&rsquo;s ancestors. The suggestion derives further
      weight from the fact that Osiris is invariably represented as a mummy, and
      that he wears a peculiar head-dress or cap of office, the same as that
      which was used in historical times as the crown of Upper Egypt. He also
      holds in his hands the crook and scourge which are the marks of kingly
      office&mdash;the crook to lead his own people like a shepherd, the scourge
      to punish evil-doers and to ward off enemies. His image is therefore
      nothing more nor less than the image of a Mummied King. Sometimes, too, he
      wears in addition the regal ostrich plumes. Surely, naught save the blind
      infatuation of mythologists could make them overlook the plain inference
      that Osiris was a mummified chief of Abydos in the days before the
      unification of Egypt under a single rule, and that he was worshipped by
      his successors in the petty principality exactly as we know other kingly
      mummies were worshipped by their family elsewhere&mdash;exactly, for
      example, as on the famous Tablet of Ancestors found at Abydos itself,
      Sethi I. and Rameses II. are seen offering homage to seventy-six
      historical kings, their predecessors on the throne of United Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only, however, is Osiris represented as a king and a mummy, but we are
      expressly told by Plutarch (or at least by the author of the tract <i>De
      Osiride</i> which bears his name) that the tomb of Osiris existed at
      Abydos, and that the richest and most powerful of the Egyptians were
      desirous of being buried in the adjacent cemetery, in order that <span
      class="pagenum">167</span><a name="link167" id="link167"></a>they might
      lie, as it were, in the same grave with the great god of their country.
      All this is perfectly comprehensible and natural if we suppose that a
      Thinite dynasty first conquered the whole of Egypt; that it extended the
      worship of its own local ancestor-god over the entire country; and that in
      time, when this worship had assumed national importance, the local god
      became the chief figure in the common pantheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had arrived at this opinion independently before I was aware that Mr.
      Loftie had anticipated me in it. But in his rare and interesting <i>Essay
      on Scarabs</i> I find he has reached the same conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The divinity of Pharaoh,&rdquo; says Mr. Loftie, &ldquo;was the
      first article in the creed of the pyramid period, the earliest of which we
      know anything. As time went on, though the king was still called divine,
      we see him engaged in the worship of other gods. At last he appears as a
      priest himself; and when Herodotus and the later Greek historians visited
      Egypt, there was so little of this part of the old religion left that it
      is not even mentioned by them as a matter of importance.&rdquo; This is
      quite natural, I may remark parenthetically, for as the antiquity and
      grandeur of the great gods increased, the gulf between them and mere men,
      even though those men were kings, their offspring, must always have grown
      ever wider and wider. &ldquo;I have myself no doubt whatever,&rdquo; Mr.
      Loftie goes on, &ldquo;that the names of Osiris and of Horus are those of
      ancient rulers. I think that, long before authentic history begins, Asar
      and Aset his wife reigned in Egypt, probably in that wide valley of the
      Upper Nile which is now the site of Girgeh and Berbé&rdquo; (exactly where
      I place the principality of Osiris). &ldquo;Their son was Hor, or Horus,
      the first king of Upper and Lower Egypt; and the &lsquo;Hor seshoo.&rsquo;
      the successors of Horus, are not obscurely mentioned by later chroniclers.
      I know that this view is not shared by all students of the subject, and
      much learning and ingenuity have been spent to prove that Asar, and Aset,
      and Hor, and <span class="pagenum">168</span><a name="link168" id="link168"></a>Ptah,
      and Anep, are representations of the powers of nature; that they do not
      point to ancient princes, but to ancient principles; and that Horus and
      his successors are gods and were never men. But in the oldest inscriptions
      we find none of that mysticism which is shown in the sculptures from the
      time of the eighteenth dynasty down to the Ptolemies and the Roman
      Emperors.&rdquo; In short, Mr. Loftie goes on to set forth a theory of the
      origin of the great gods essentially similar to the one I am here
      defending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though a little out of place, I cannot help noting here the curious
      confirmatory fact that a number of ibis mummies have been found at Abvdos
      in close proximity to the mound where M. Mariette confidently expected to
      discover in the rock the actual tomb of Osiris himself. Hence we may
      conclude that the ibis was in all probability the totem of Abydos or This,
      as the bull was of Memphis, the crocodile of the Fayoum, the cat of
      Bubastis, and the baboon of Thebes. Now, the ibis-god of Abydos is Thoth;
      and it is noteworthy that Thoth, as recorder, always accompanies Osiris,
      in later legend, as judge of the dead: the local mummy-god, in other
      words, has as his assessor the local totem-god; and both are commonly to
      be seen on the monuments of Abydos, in company with Horus, Anubis, Isis,
      and other (probably) local divinities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite easy to see how, with this origin, Osiris would almost
      inevitably grow with time to be the King of the Dead, and supreme judge of
      the nether regions. For, as the most sacred of the ancestors of the regal
      line, he would naturally be the one whom the kings, in their turn, would
      most seek to propitiate, and whom they would look forward to joining in
      their eternal home. As the myth extended, and as mystical interpretations
      began to creep in, identifications being made of the gods with the sun or
      other natural energies, the original meaning of Osiris-worship would grow
      gradually obscured. But to the last, Osiris himself, in spite of all
      corruptions, is represented <span class="pagenum">169</span><a
      name="link169" id="link169"></a>as a mummy: and even when identified with
      Amen, the later intrusive god, he still wears his mummy-bandages, and
      still bears the crook and scourge and sceptre of his primitive kingship.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be objected, however, that there were many forms of Orisis, and
      many local gods who bore the same name. He was buried at Abydos, but was
      also equally buried at Memphis, and at Philæ as well. The pretty little
      &ldquo;Temple on the Roof&rdquo; at Denderah is an exquisitely elaborate
      chapel to the local Osiris of that town, with chambers dedicated to the
      various other Osiris-gods of the forty-two nomes of ancient Egypt. Well,
      that fact runs exactly parallel with the local Madonnas and the local
      Apollos of other religions: and nobody has suggested doubts as to the
      human reality of the Blessed Virgin Mary because so many different Maries
      exist in different sacred sites or in different cathedrals. Our Lady of
      Loretto is the same as Our Lady of Lourdes. Jesus of Nazareth was
      nevertheless born at Bethlehem: he was the son of Joseph, but he was also
      the son of David, and the son of God. Perhaps Osiris was a common noun:
      perhaps a slightly different Osiris was worshipped in various towns of
      later Egypt; perhaps a local mummy-god, the ancestor of some extinct
      native line, often wrongly usurped the name and prerogatives of the great
      mummy-god of Abydos, especially under the influence of late priestly
      mysticism. Moreover, when we come to consider the subject of the
      manufacture of gods, we shall see that the body of an annual incarnation
      of Osiris may have been divided and distributed among all the nomes of
      Egypt. It is enough for my present purpose if I point out in brief that
      ancestor-worship amply explains the rise and prevalence of the cult of
      Osiris, the kingly mummy, with the associated cults of Horus, Isis, Thoth,
      and the other deities of the Osirian cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may add that a gradual growth of Osiris-worship is clearly marked on the
      monuments themselves. The simpler <span class="pagenum">170</span><a
      name="link170" id="link170"></a>stelæ and memorials of the earliest age
      seldom contain the names of any god, but display votaries making offerings
      at the shrine of ancestors. Similarly, the scenes represented on the walls
      of tombs of early date bear no reference to the great gods of later ages,
      but are merely domestic and agricultural in character, as may be observed
      at Sakkarah and even to some extent also at Beni-Hassan. Under the Sixth
      Dynasty, the monuments begin to make more and more frequent mention of
      Osiris, who now comes to be regarded as Judge of the Dead and Lord of the
      Lower World; and on a tablet of this age in the Boulak Museum occurs for
      the first time the expression afterwards so common, &ldquo;justified by
      Osiris.&rdquo; Under the Twelfth Dynasty, legend becomes more prominent; a
      solar and lunar character seems to be given by reflex to Osiris and Isis:
      and the name of Ra, the sun, is added to that of many previously distinct
      and independent deities. Khem, the ithyphallic god of the Thebaid, now
      also assumes greater importance, as is quite natural under a line of
      Theban princes: and Khem, a local mummy-god, is always represented in his
      swathing-clothes, and afterwards confounded, certainly with Amen, and
      probably also with the mummy-god of Abydos. But Osiris from this time
      forward rises distinctly into the front rank as a deity. &ldquo;To him,
      rather than to the dead, the friends and family offer their sacrifices. A
      court is formed for him. Thoth, the recorder [totem-god of Abydos], Anubis
      the watcher, Ra the impersonation of truth, and others, assist in judgment
      on the soul.&rdquo; The name of the deceased is henceforth constantly
      accompanied by the formula &ldquo;justified by Osiris.&rdquo; About the
      same time the Book of the Dead in its full form came into existence, with
      its developed conception of the lower world, and its complicated
      arrangement of planes of purgatorial progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Eighteenth Dynasty, the legend thickens; the identifications of
      the gods become more and more intricate; Amen and Ra are sought and found
      under innumerable <span class="pagenum">171</span><a name="link171"
      id="link171"></a>forms of other deities; and a foundation is laid for the
      esoteric Monotheism or pantheistic nature-worship of the later
      philosophising priesthood. It was under the Nineteenth Dynasty that the
      cult of local Triads or Trinities took fullest shape, and that the
      mystical interpretation of the religion of Egypt came well into the
      foreground. The great Osirian myth was then more and more minutely and
      mystically elaborated; and even the bull Apis, the totem-god of Memphis,
      was recognised as a special incarnation of Osiris, who thus becomes, with
      Amen, the mysterious summing-up of almost all the national pantheon. At
      last we find the myth going off into pure mysticism, Osiris being at once
      the father, brother, husband, and son of Isis, and also the son of his own
      child Horus. * Sentences with an almost Athanasian mixture of vagueness
      and definiteness inform us how &ldquo;the son proceeds from the father,
      and the father proceeds from his son&rdquo;; how &ldquo;Ra is the soul of
      Osiris, and Osiris the soul of Ra and how Horus his child, awakened by
      magical rites from his dead body, is victorious over Set, the prince of
      darkness, and sits as Osiris upon the throne of the father whom he has
      revived and avenged. Here as elsewhere the myth, instead of being the
      explanation of the god, does nothing more than darken counsel.&rdquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;Stories like the Osiris myth,&rdquo; says Mr. Lang, &ldquo;spring
     from no pure religious source, but embody the delusions and
     fantastic dreams of the lowest and least developed human
     fancy and human speculation.&rdquo; This sentence enforces
     precisely the same idea that I have previously expressed in
     chapter ii. as to the real relations of religion and
     mythology. The myth nowhere explains the cult; it casts no
     light upon its origin or history; on the contrary, it only
     obscures and overshadows the underlying kernel of genuine
     fact.
</pre>
    <p>
      In like manner, I believe, Ptah was originally a local mummy-god of
      Memphis, and Khem of Ap, afterwards known as Chemmis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gradual growth of a dead and mummified village chief, however, into a
      pantheistic god, strange as it may seem, is not in any way more remarkable
      than the gradual growth <span class="pagenum">172</span><a name="link172"
      id="link172"></a>of a Galilean peasant into the second person of an
      eternal and omnipotent Godhead. Nor does the myth of the death and
      resurrection of Osiris (to be considered hereafter in a later chapter)
      militate against the reality of his human existence any more than the
      history of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ militates against
      the human existence of Jesus of Nazareth. &ldquo;Gross and crude
      euphemerism&rdquo; may be bad; but airy and fantastic Max-mullerism
      appears to me just as unphilosophical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty of the evolution, indeed, is not at all great, if we
      consider the further fact that even after the concept of godship had been
      fully developed, the king still remained of like nature with the gods,
      their son and descendant, a divine personage himself, differing from them
      only in not having yet received eternal life, the symbol of which they are
      often shown in sculpture as presenting with gracious expressions to their
      favoured scion. &ldquo;The ruling sovereign of Egypt,&rdquo; says Mr. Le
      Page Renouf, &ldquo;was the living image of and vicegerent of the sun-god.
      He was invested with the attributes of divinity, and that in the earliest
      times of which we possess monumental evidence.&rdquo; And quite naturally,
      for in antique times gods had ruled in Egypt, whose successor the king
      was: and the kings before Menes were significantly known as &ldquo;the
      successors of Horus.&rdquo; As late as the times of the Ptolemies, we saw,
      there were priests of Menes and other Pharaohs of the most ancient
      dynasties. The pyramid kings took the title of the Golden Horus,
      afterwards copied by their descendants; and from Chafra onward the
      reigning monarch was known as the Son of Ra and the Great God. Amenophis
      IL, during his own lifetime, is &ldquo;a god good like Ra, the sacred seed
      of Amen, the son whom he begot.&rdquo; And on all the monuments the king
      is represented of the same superhuman stature as the gods themselves: he
      converses with them on equal terms; they lead him by the hand into their
      inmost sanctuaries, or present him with the symbols of royal rule and of
      eternal life, like friends of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">173</span><a name="link173" id="link173"></a>former
      guerdon bestows upon him the same rank they themselves had held on earth;
      the latter advances him to share with them the glories of the other
      existence. In the temple of Kurneh, Rameses I. (then dead) receives the
      offerings and liturgies of his royal grandson. Hard by, Rameses II. offers
      to Amen-ra, Khonso, and Rameses I., without distinction of divinity. On
      the side wall, Sethi I. receives similar divine honours from the royal
      hands: while in the centre chamber Sethi himself officiates before the
      statue of his father placed in a shrine. The King is thus but the Living
      God: the God is thus but the Dead King.
    </p>
    <p>
      I conclude, therefore, that a large part of the greater Egyptian gods&mdash;the
      national or local gods, as opposed to those worshipped by each family in
      its own necropolis&mdash;were early kings, whose myths were later expanded
      into legends, rationalised into nature-worship, and adorned by priestly
      care with endless symbolical or esoteric fancies. But down to the very
      latest age of independence, inscriptions of the god Euergetes, and the
      goddess Berenice, or representations like that at Philæ, of the god
      Philadelphus suckled by Isis, show that to the Egyptian mind the gulf
      between humanity and divinity was very narrow, and that the original
      manhood of all the deities was an idea quite familiar to priests and
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, another class of gods about which we can be somewhat
      less certain; these are the animal-gods and animal-headed gods which
      developed out of the totems of the various villages. Such bestial types,
      Professor Sayce remarks, &ldquo;take us back to a remote prehistoric age,
      when the religious creed of Egypt,&rdquo; say rather, the custom of Egypt,
      &ldquo;was still totemism.&rdquo; But in what precise relation totemism
      stood to the main line of the evolution of gods I do not feel quite so
      sure in my own mind as does Mr. Herbert Spencer. It seems to me possible
      that the totem may in its origin have been merely the lucky-beast or badge
      of a particular tribe (like the regimental <span class="pagenum">174</span><a
      name="link174" id="link174"></a>goat or deer); and that from being at
      first petted, domesticated, and to some extent respected on this account,
      it may have grown at last, through a confusion of ideas, to share the same
      sort of divine honours which were paid to the ghosts of ancestors and the
      gods evolved from them. But Mr. Frazer has suggested a better origin of
      totemism from the doctrine of the Separable Soul, which is, up to date,
      the best explanation yet offered of this obscure subject. Be that as it
      may, if the totems were only gradually elevated into divinities, we can
      easily understand Mr. Renouf&rsquo;s remark that the long series of tombs
      of the Apis bulls at Sakkarah shows &ldquo;how immeasurably greater the
      devotion to the sacred animals was in the later times than in the former.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      May I add that the <i>worship</i> of totems, as distinct from the mere <i>care</i>
      implied by Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s suggestion, very probably arose from the
      custom of carving the totem-animal of the deceased on the grave-stake or
      grave-board? This custom is still universal among the Indian tribes of
      Northwestern America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, whatever be the true origin of the totem-gods, I do not
      think totemism militates in any way against the general principle of the
      evolution of the idea of a god from the ghost, the Dead Man, or the
      deified ancestor. For only after the concept of a god had been formed from
      ancestor-cult, and only after worship had been evolved from the customary
      offerings to the mummy or spirit at the tomb, could any other object by
      any possibility be elevated to the godhead. Nor, on the other hand, as I
      have before remarked, do I feel inclined wholly to agree with Mr. Spencer
      that every individual god was necessarily once a particular Dead Man. It
      seems to me indubitable that after the idea of godhead had become fully
      fixed in the human mind, some gods at least began to be recognised who
      were directly framed either from abstract conceptions, from natural
      objects, or from pure outbursts of the mythopoeic faculty. I do not think,
      therefore, that the existence <span class="pagenum">175</span><a
      name="link175" id="link175"></a>of a certain (relatively unimportant)
      class of totem-gods in Egypt or elsewhere is necessarily inconsistent in
      any way with our main theory of the origin of godhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be this as it may, it is at any rate clear that totemism itself was a very
      ancient and widespread institution in early Egypt. Totems are defined by
      Mr. Frazer as &ldquo;a class of material objects which a savage regards
      with superstitious respect, believing that there exists between him and
      every member of the class an intimate and altogether special relation.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Observation of existing totem tribes in Africa, Australia, and
      elsewhere,&rdquo; says Sir Martin Conway, &ldquo;shows us that one or more
      representatives of the totem are often fed or even kept alive in captivity
      by the tribe.&rdquo; Mr. Frazer tells us that &ldquo;amongst the
      Nar-rinyeri in South Australia, men of the snake clan sometimes catch
      snakes, pull out their teeth, or sew up their mouths, and keep them as
      pets. In a pigeon clan of Samoa a pigeon was carefully kept and fed.
      Amongst the Kalong in Java, whose totem is a red dog, each family as a
      rule keeps one of these animals, which they will on no account allow to be
      struck or ill-used by any one.&rdquo; In the same way, no doubt, certain
      Egyptian clans kept sacred bulls, cats, crocodiles, hawks, jackals,
      cobras, lizards, ibises, asps, and beetles. Mummies of most of these
      sacred animals, and little images of others, are common in the
      neighbourhood of certain places where they were specially worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the animal-headed gods represent a later stage of the same
      totem-worship, or whether they stand merely for real ancestor-gods
      belonging to a particular totem-clan, and therefore represented by its
      totem, is not a question easily settled. But at any rate it is clear that
      many gods are the equivalents of such totem-animals, as is the case with
      the hawk-headed Horus, the jackal-headed Anubis, the cow-headed Athor, the
      ram-headed Knum, the cat-headed Pasht, the lion-headed Sekhet, the
      ibis-headed <span class="pagenum">176</span><a name="link176" id="link176"></a>Thoth,
      and the kestrel-headed Khons. These gods appear on the earlier monuments
      as beasts alone, not as human forms with bestial heads. Till the Twelfth
      Dynasty, when a totem-god is mentioned (which is not often), &ldquo;he is
      represented,&rdquo; says Mr. Flinders Petrie, &ldquo;by his animal.&rdquo;
      Anubis, for example, at this stage, is merely a jackal; and as M. Maspero
      puts it, &ldquo;Whatever may have been the object of worship in
      Thoth-Ibis, it was a bird, not a hieroglyph, that the earliest
      ibis-worshippers adored.&rdquo; There were other totems, however, which
      were less fruitful in deities, but which entered largely in artistic forms
      into the later religious symbolism. Such were especially the asp and the
      sacred scarabæus, which almost rival the sun-disk in the large part they
      play in the developed religious art-language of the great temple-building
      dynasties. I may add that among the other symbols of this curious
      emblematical picture-writing are the Tau or <i>crux ansata</i>, by origin
      apparently a combined <i>linga</i> and <i>yoni</i>; the lotus, the
      sceptre, the leek, and the crescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, yet a third class of divine or quasidivine beings in
      the newer Egyptian Pantheon to which Mr. Andrew Lang, in his able
      introduction to the <i>Euterpe</i> of Herodotus, still allows that great
      importance may be attached. These are the elemental or seemingly elemental
      deities, the Nature-Gods who play so large a part in all rationalistic or
      mystical mythologies. Such are no doubt Nut and Seb, the personal heaven
      and earth, named as early as the inscription on the coffin of Menkaoura of
      the Fourth Dynasty in the British Museum: such perhaps (though far less
      certainly) are Khons, identified with the rising sun, and Tum, regarded as
      the impersonation of his nightly setting. But none of the quite obviously
      elemental gods, except Ra, play any large part in the actual and practical
      worship of the people: to adopt the broad distinction I have ventured to
      draw in our second chapter, they are gods to talk about, not gods to adore&mdash;mythological
      conceptions rather than religious beings. Their names occur <span
      class="pagenum">177</span><a name="link177" id="link177"></a>much in the
      sacred texts, but their images are rare and their temples unknown. It is
      not Nut or Seb whose figures we see carved abundantly in relief on the
      grey sandstone pillars of Karnak and Luxor, painted in endless file on the
      gesso-covered walls of the Tombs of the Kings, or represented by dozens in
      the great collection of little bronze idols that fill so many cabinets at
      the Boulak Museum. The actual objects of the highest worship are far other
      than these abstract elemental conceptions: they are Osiris, Isis, Horus,
      Anubis, Khem, Pasht, and Athor. The quaint or grotesque incised figures of
      Nut, represented as a female form with arms and legs extended like a
      living canopy over the earth, as at Denderah, belong, I believe, almost if
      not quite exclusively to the Ptolemaic period, when zodiacal and
      astrological conceptions had been freely borrowed by the Egyptians from
      Greece and Asia. Nut and Seb, as gods, not myths, are in short quite
      recent ideas in Egypt. Even sun-disk Ra, himself, important as he becomes
      in the later developed creed, is hardly so much in his origin a separate
      god as an adjunct or symbol of divinity united syncretically with the
      various other deities. To call a king the sun is a common piece of
      courtier flattery. It is as Amen-Ra or as Osiris that the sun receives
      most actual worship. His name is joined to the names of gods as to the
      names of kings: he is almost as much a symbol as the Tau or the Asp; he
      obtains little if any adoration in his simple form, but plenty when
      conjoined in a compound conception with some more practical deity of
      strictly human origin. Even at the great &ldquo;Temple of the Sun&rdquo;
      at Heliopolis, it was as the bull Men or Mnevis that the luminary was
      adored: and that cult, according to Manetho, went back as far as the
      totemistic times of the Second Dynasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put it briefly, then, I hold that the element of nature-worship is a
      late gloss or superadded factor in the Egyptian religion; that it is
      always rather mythological or explanatory than religious in the strict
      sense; and that it does <span class="pagenum">178</span><a name="link178"
      id="link178"></a>not in the least interfere with our general inference
      that the real Egyptian gods as a whole were either ancestral or totemistic
      in origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the evidence before us, broadly considered, we may fairly conclude,
      then, that the earliest cult of Egypt consisted of pure ancestor-worship,
      complicated by a doubtfully religious element of totemism, which
      afterwards by one means or another interwove itself closely with the whole
      ghostly worship of the country. The later gods were probably deified
      ancestors of the early tribal kings, sometimes directly worshipped as
      mummies, and sometimes perhaps represented by their totem-animals or later
      still by human figures with animal heads. Almost every one of these great
      gods is localised to a particular place&mdash;&ldquo;Lord of Abydos,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Mistress of Senem,&rdquo; &ldquo;President of Thebes,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Dweller at Hermopolis,&rdquo; as would naturally be the case if
      they were locally-deified princes, admitted at last into a national
      pantheon. In the earliest period of which any monuments remain to us, the
      ancestor-worship was purer, simpler, and freer from symbolism or from the
      cult of the great gods than at any later time. With the gradual evolution
      of the creed and the pantheon, however, legends and myths increased, the
      syncretic tendency manifested itself everywhere, identifications
      multiplied, mysticism grew rife, and an esoteric faith, with leanings
      towards a vague pantheistic monotheism, endeavoured to rationalise and to
      explain away the more gross and foolish portions of the original belief.
      It is the refinements and glosses of this final philosophical stage that
      pass current for the most part in systematic works as the true doctrines
      of Egyptian religion, and that so many modern enquirers have erroneously
      treated as equivalent to the earliest product of native thought. The ideas
      as to the unity of God, and the sun-myths of Horus, Isis, and Osiris, are
      clearly late developments or excrescences on the original creed, and
      betray throughout the esoteric spirit of priestly interpretation. To the
      very last, the Worship of the Dead, and the <span class="pagenum">179</span><a
      name="link179" id="link179"></a> crude polytheism based upon it, were the
      true religion of the ancient Egyptians, as we see it expressed in all the
      monuments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the religious world into which, if we may believe the oldest
      Semitic traditions, the Sons of Israel brought their God Jahweh and their
      other deities from beyond the Euphrates at a very remote period of their
      national history. And such, in its fuller and more mystical form, was the
      religion practised and taught in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, at the moment
      when the Christian faith was just beginning to evolve itself round the
      historical nucleus of the man Christ Jesus, and him crucified.

      class="pagenum">180</span><a name="link180" id="link180"></a>only people
      who ever invented or evolved a pure monotheism at first hand were the
      Jews. Individual thinkers elsewhere approached or aimed at that ideal
      goal, like the Egyptian priests and the Greek philosophers: entire races
      elsewhere borrowed monotheism from the Hebrews, like the Arabs under
      Mohammad, or, to a less extent, the Romans and the modern European
      nations, when they adopted Christianity in its trinitarian form: but no
      other race ever succeeded as a whole in attaining by their own exertions
      the pure monotheistic platform, however near certain persons among them
      might have arrived to such attainment in esoteric or mystical
      philosophising. It is the peculiar glory of Israel to have <i>evolved God</i>.
      And the evolution of God from the diffuse gods of the earlier Semitic
      religion is Israel&rsquo;s great contribution to the world&rsquo;s
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sacred books of the Jews, as we possess them in garbled forms to-day,
      assign this peculiar belief to the very earliest ages of their race: they
      assume that Abraham, the mythical common father of all the Semitic tribes,
      was already a monotheist; and they even treat monotheism as at a still
      remoter date the universal religion of the entire world, from which all
      polytheistic cults were but a corruption and a falling away. Such a belief
      is nowadays, of course, wholly untenable. So also is the crude notion that
      monotheism was smitten out at a single blow by the genius of one
      individual man, Moses, at the moment <span class="pagenum">181</span><a
      name="link181" id="link181"></a>of the Hebrew exodus from Egypt. The bare
      idea that one particular thinker, just escaped from the midst of ardent
      polytheists, whose religion embraced an endless pantheon and a low form of
      animal-worship, could possibly have invented a pure monotheistic cult, is
      totally opposed to every known psychological law of human nature. The real
      stages by which monotheism was evolved out of a preceding polytheism in a
      single small group of Semitic tribes have already been well investigated
      by Dutch and German scholars: all that I propose to do in the present
      volume is to reconsider the subject from our broader anthropological
      standpoint, and show how in the great Jewish god himself we may still
      discern, as in a glass, darkly, the vague but constant lineaments of an
      ancestral ghost-deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down to a comparatively late period of Jewish history, as we now know,
      Jahweh was but one and the highest among a considerable group of
      Israelitish divinities; the first among his peers, like Zeus among the
      gods of Hellas, Osiris or Amen among the gods of Egypt, and Woden or
      Thunor among the gods of the old Teutonic pantheon. As late as the century
      of Hezekiah, the religion of the great mass of the Israelites and Jews was
      still a broad though vague polytheism. The gods seem to have been as
      numerous and as localised as in Egypt: &ldquo;According to the number of
      thy cities are thy gods, O Judah,&rdquo; says the prophet Jeremiah in the
      sixth century. It was only by a slow process of syncretism, by the
      absorption into Jahweh-worship of all other conflicting creeds, that
      Israel at last attained its full ideal of pure monotheism. That ideal was
      never finally reached by the people at large till the return from the
      captivity: it had only even been aimed at by a few ardent and exclusive
      Jahweh-worshippers in the last dangerous and doubtful years of national
      independence which immediately preceded the Babylonish exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to understand the inner nature of this curious gradual revolution
      we must look briefly, first, at the general character <span class="pagenum">182</span><a
      name="link182" id="link182"></a>of the old Hebrew polytheism; and
      secondly, at the original cult of the great ethnical god Jahweh himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of their long sojourn in Egypt, the national religion of the
      Hebrews, when we first begin dimly to descry its features through the veil
      of later glosses, is regarded by almost all modern investigators as truly
      Semitic and local in origin. It is usually described as embracing three
      principal forms of cult: the worship of the <i>teraphim</i> or family
      gods; the worship of sacred stones; and the worship of certain great gods,
      partly native, partly perhaps borrowed; some of them adored in the form of
      animals, and some apparently elemental or solar in their acquired
      attributes. Although for us these three are one, I shall examine them here
      in that wonted order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cult of the <i>teraphim</i>, I think, we cannot consider, on a broad
      anthropological view, otherwise than as the equivalent of all the other
      family cults known to us; that is to say, in other words, as pure
      unadulterated domestic ancestor-worship. &ldquo;By that name,&rdquo; says
      Kuenen, &ldquo;were indicated larger or smaller images, which were
      worshipped as household gods, and upon which the happiness of the family
      was supposed to depend.&rdquo; In the legend of Jacob&rsquo;s flight from
      Laban, we are told how Rachel stole her father&rsquo;s teraphim: and when
      the angry chieftain overtakes the fugitives, he enquires of them why they
      have robbed him of his domestic gods. Of Micah, we learn that he made
      images of his teraphim, and consecrated one of his own sons to be his
      family priest: such a domestic and private priesthood being exactly what
      we are accustomed to find in the worship of ancestral <i>manes</i>
      everywhere. Even through the mist of the later Jehovistic recension we
      catch, in passing, frequent glimpses of the early worship of these family
      gods, one of which is described as belonging to Michal, the daughter of
      Saul and wife of David; while Hosea alludes to them as stocks of wood, and
      Zechariah as idols that speak lies to the people. It is clear <span
      class="pagenum">183</span><a name="link183" id="link183"></a>that the
      teraphim were preserved in each household with reverential care, that they
      were sacrificed to by the family at stated intervals, and that they were
      consulted on all occasions of doubt or difficulty by a domestic priest
      clad in an ephod. I think, then, if we put these indications side by side
      with those of family cults elsewhere, we may conclude that the Jewish
      religion, like all others, was based upon an ultimate foundation of
      general ancestor-worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been denied, indeed, that ancestor-worship pure and simple ever
      existed among the Semitic races. A clear contradiction of this denial is
      furnished by M. Lenormant, who comments thus on sepulchral monuments from
      Yemen: &ldquo;Here, then, we have twice repeated a whole series of human
      persons, decidedly deceased ancestors or relations of the authors of the
      dedications. Their names are accompanied with the titles they bore during
      life. They are invoked by their descendants in the same way as the gods.
      They are incontestably deified persons, objects of a family worship, and
      gods or genii in the belief of the people of their race.&rdquo; After
      this, we need not doubt that the teraphim were the images of such family
      gods or ancestral spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not surprising, however, that these domestic gods play but a small
      part in the history of the people as it has come down to us in the late
      Jehovistic version of the Hebrew traditions. Nowhere in literature, even
      under the most favourable circumstances, do we hear much of the <i>manes</i>
      and <i>lares</i>, compared with the great gods of national worship. Nor
      were such minor divinities likely to provoke the wrath even of that
      &ldquo;jealous god&rdquo; who later usurped all the adoration of Israel:
      so that denunciations of their votaries are comparatively rare in the
      rhapsodies of the prophets. &ldquo;Their use,&rdquo; says Kuenen, speaking
      of the teraphim, &ldquo;was very general, and was by no means considered
      incompatible with the worship of Jahweh.&rdquo; They were regarded merely
      as family affairs, poor foemen for <span class="pagenum">184</span><a
      name="link184" id="link184"></a>the great and awesome tribal god who bore
      no rival near his throne, and would not suffer the pretensions of Molech
      or of the Baalim. To use a modern analogy, their cult was as little
      inconsistent with Jahweh-worship as a belief in fairies, banshees, or
      family ghosts was formerly inconsistent with a belief in Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conclusion will doubtless strike the reader at once as directly
      opposed to the oft-repeated assertion that the early Hebrews had little or
      no conception of the life beyond the grave and of the doctrine of future
      rewards and punishments. I am afraid it cannot be denied that such is the
      case. Hard as it is to run counter to so much specialist opinion, I can
      scarcely see how any broad anthropological enquirer may deny to the
      Semites of the tenth and twelfth centuries before Christ participation in
      an almost (or quite) universal human belief, common to the lowest savages
      and the highest civilisations, and particularly well developed in that
      Egyptian society with which the ancestors of the Hebrews had so long
      rubbed shoulders. The subject, however, is far too large a one for full
      debate here. I must content myself with pointing out that, apart from the
      <i>a priori</i> improbability of such a conclusion, the Hebrew documents
      themselves contain numerous allusions, even in their earliest traditional
      fragments, to the belief in ghosts and in the world of shades, as well as
      to the probability of future resurrection. The habit of cave-burial and of
      excavated grotto-burial; the importance attached to the story of the
      purchase of Machpelah; the common phrase that such-and-such a patriarch
      &ldquo;was gathered to his people,&rdquo; or &ldquo;slept with his fathers&rdquo;;
      the embalming of Joseph, and the carrying up of his bones from Egypt to
      Palestine; the episode of Saul and the ghost of Samuel; and indeed the
      entire conception of Sheol, the place of the departed&mdash;all alike show
      that the Hebrew belief in this respect did not largely differ in
      essentials from the general belief of surrounding peoples. The very
      frequency of allusions to witchcraft and necromancy <span class="pagenum">185</span><a
      name="link185" id="link185"></a>point in the same direction; while the
      common habit of assuming a priestly or sacrificial garment, the <i>ephod</i>,
      and then consulting the family teraphim as a domestic oracle, is strictly
      in accordance with all that we know of the minor ancestor-worship as it
      occurs elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closely connected with the teraphim is the specific worship at tombs or
      graves. &ldquo;The whole north Semitic area,&rdquo; says Professor
      Robertson Smith, &ldquo;was dotted over with sacred tombs, Memnonia,
      Semiramis mounds, and the like; and at every such spot a god or demigod
      had his subterranean abode.&rdquo; This, of course, is pure
      ancestor-worship. Traces of still older cave-burial are also common in the
      Hebrew Scriptures. &ldquo;At the present day,&rdquo; says Professor Smith,
      &ldquo;almost every sacred site in Palestine has its grotto, and that this
      is no new thing is plain from the numerous symbols of Astarte-worship
      found on the walls of caves in Phoenicia. There can be little doubt that
      the oldest Phoenician temples were natural or artificial grottoes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We are fairly entitled to conclude, then, I believe, that a domestic cult
      of the <i>manes</i> or <i>lares</i>, the family dead, formed the general
      substratum of early Hebrew religion, though as in all other cases, owing
      to its purely personal nature, this universal cult makes but a small
      figure in the literature of the race, compared with the worship of the
      greater national gods and goddesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second in the list of worshipful objects in early Israel come the sacred
      stones, about which I have already said a good deal in the chapter devoted
      to that interesting subject, but concerning whose special nature in the
      Semitic field a few more words may here be fitly added.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now very generally admitted that stone-worship played an exceedingly
      large and important part in the primitive Semitic religion. How important
      a part we may readily gather from many evidences, but from none more than
      from the fact that even Mohammad himself was unable to exclude from Islam,
      the most monotheistic of all <span class="pagenum">186</span><a
      name="link186" id="link186"></a>known religious systems, the holy black
      stone of the Kaaba at Mecca. In Arabia, says Professor Robertson Smith,
      the altar or hewn stone is unknown, and in its place we find the rude
      pillar or the cairn, beside which the sacrificial victim is slain, the
      blood being poured out over the stone or at its base. But in Israel, the
      shaped stone seems the more usual mark of the ghost or god. Such a sacred
      stone, we have already seen, was known to the early Hebrews as a Beth-el,
      that is to say an &ldquo;abode of deity,&rdquo; from the common belief
      that it was inhabited by a god, ghost, or spirit. The great prevalence of
      the cult of stones among the Semites, however, is further indicated by the
      curious circumstance that this word was borrowed by the Greeks and Romans
      (in a slightly altered form) to denote the stones so supposed to be
      inhabited by deities. References to such gods abound throughout the Hebrew
      books, though they are sometimes denounced as idolatrous images, and
      sometimes covered with a thin veneer of Jehovism by being connected with
      the national heroes and with the later Jahweh-worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the legend of Jacob&rsquo;s dream we get a case where the sacred stone
      is anointed and a promise is made to it of a tenth of the speaker&rsquo;s
      substance as an offering. And again, on a later occasion, we learn that
      Jacob &ldquo;set up a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink-offering
      thereon, and he poured oil thereon;&rdquo; just as, in the great phallic
      worship of the linga in India (commonly called the <i>linga puja</i>), a
      cylindrical pillar, rounded at the top, and universally considered as a
      phallus in its nature, is worshipped by pouring upon it one of five sacred
      anointing liquids, water, milk, ghee, oil, and wine. Similar rites are
      offered in many other places to other sacred stones; and in many cases the
      phallic value assigned to them is clearly shown by the fact that it is
      usual for sterile women to pray to them for the blessing of children, as
      Hindu wives pray to Mahadeo, and as so many Hebrew women (to be noted
      hereafter) <span class="pagenum">187</span><a name="link187" id="link187"></a>are
      mentioned in our texts as praying to Jahweh.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brief catalogue of the chief stone-deities alluded to in Hebrew
      literature may help to enforce the importance of the subject: and it may
      be noted in passing that the stones are often mentioned in connexion with
      sacred trees&mdash;an association with which we are already familiar. In
      the neighbourhood of Sichem was an oak&mdash;the &ldquo;oak of the
      prophets&rdquo; or &ldquo;oak of the soothsayers&rdquo;&mdash;by which lay
      a stone, whose holiness is variously accounted for by describing it as, in
      one place, an altar of Abraham, in another an altar of Jacob, and in a
      third a memorial of Joshua. But the fact shows that it was resorted to for
      sacrifice, and that oracles or responses were sought from it by its
      votaries. That is to say, it was a sepulchral monument. Near Hebron stood
      &ldquo;the oak of Mamre,&rdquo; and under it a sacred stone, accounted for
      as an altar of Abraham, to which in David&rsquo;s time sacrifices were
      offered. Near Beersheba we find yet a third tree, the tamarisk, said to
      have been planted by Abraham, and an altar or stone pillar ascribed to
      Isaac. In the camp at Gilgal were &ldquo;the twelve stones,&rdquo;
      sometimes, apparently, spoken of as &ldquo;the graven images,&rdquo; but
      sometimes explained away as memorials of Jahweh&rsquo;s help at the
      passing of the Jordan. Other examples are Ebenezer, &ldquo;the helpful
      stone,&rdquo; and Tobeleth, the &ldquo;serpent-stone,&rdquo; as well as
      the &ldquo;great stone&rdquo; to which sacrifices were offered at
      Bethshemesh, and the other great stone at Gibeon, which was also, no
      doubt, an early Hebrew deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So often is the name of Abraham connected with these stones, indeed, that,
      as some German scholars have suggested, Abraham himself may perhaps be
      regarded as a sacred boulder, the rock from which Israel originally;
      sprang.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, I need hardly say, we must look upon such sacred stones as
      themselves a further evidence of ancestor-worship in Palestine, on the
      analogy of all similar stones elsewhere. <span class="pagenum">188</span><a
      name="link188" id="link188"></a>We may conclude that, as in previously
      noted instances, they were erected on the graves of deceased chieftains.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we come to the third and most difficult division of early Hebrew
      religion, the cult of the great gods whom the jealous Jahweh himself
      finally superseded. The personality of these gods is very obscure, partly
      because of the nature of our materials, which, being derived entirely from
      Jehovistic sources, have done their best to overshadow the &ldquo;false
      gods&rdquo;; but partly also, I believe, because, in the process of
      evolving monotheism, a syncretic movement merged almost all their united
      attributes into Jahweh himself, who thus becomes at last the all-absorbing
      synthesis of an entire pantheon. Nevertheless, we can point out one or two
      shadowy references to such greater gods, either by name alone, or by the
      form under which they were usually worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scholarship of the elder generation would no doubt have enumerated
      first among these gods the familiar names of Baal and Molech. At present,
      such an enumeration is scarcely possible. We can no longer see in the Baal
      of the existing Hebrew scriptures a single great god. We must regard the
      word rather as a common substantive,&mdash;&ldquo;the lord&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;the master,&rdquo;&mdash;descriptive of the relation of each
      distinct god to the place he inhabited. The Baalim, in other words, seem
      to have been the local deities or deified chiefs of the Semitic region;
      doubtless the dead kings or founders of families, as opposed to the lesser
      gods of each particular household. It is not improbable, therefore, that
      they were really identified with the sacred stones we have just been
      considering, and with the wooden <i>ashera</i>. The Baal is usually spoken
      of indefinitely, without a proper name, much as at Delos men spoke of
      &ldquo;the God,&rdquo; at Athens of &ldquo;the Goddess,&rdquo; and now at
      Padua of &ldquo;il Santo,&rdquo;&mdash;meaning respectively Apollo,
      Athene, St. Antony. Melcarth is thus the Baal of Tyre, Astarte the Baalath
      of Byblos; there was a Baal of Lebanon, of Mount <span class="pagenum">189</span><a
      name="link189" id="link189"></a>Hermon, of Mount Peor, and so forth. A few
      specific Baalim have their names preserved for us in the nomenclature of
      towns; such are Baal-tamar, the lord of the palm-tree; with Baal-gad,
      Baal-Berith, Baal-meon, and Baal-zephon. But in the Hebrew scriptures, as
      a rule, every effort has been made to blot out the very memory of these
      &ldquo;false gods,&rdquo; and to represent Jahweh alone as from the
      earliest period the one true prince and ruler in Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Molech, that title merely means &ldquo;the king&rdquo;; and it may
      have been applied to more than one distinct deity. Dr. Robertson Smith
      does not hesitate to hold that the particular Molech to whom human
      sacrifices of children were offered by the Jews before the captivity was
      Jahweh himself; it was to the national god, he believes, that these fiery
      rites were performed at the Tophet or pyre in the ravine just below the
      temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are thus reduced to the most nebulous details about these great gods of
      the Hebrews, other than Jahweh, in the period preceding the Babylonian
      captivity. All that is certain appears to be that a considerable number of
      local gods were worshipped here and there at special sanctuaries, each of
      which seems to have consisted of an altar or stone image, standing under a
      sacred tree or sacred grove, and combined with an <i>ashera</i>. While the
      names of Chemosh, the god of Moab, and of Dagon, the god of the
      Philistines, have come down to us with perfect frankness and clearness, no
      local Hebrew god save Jahweh has left a name that can now be discerned
      with any approach to certainty. It should be added that the worship of
      many of the gods of surrounding Semitic tribes undoubtedly extended from
      the earliest times into Israel also.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must likewise premise that the worship of the Baalim, within and without
      Israel, was specially directed to upright conical stones, the most sacred
      objects at all the sanctuaries; and that these stones are generally
      admitted to have <span class="pagenum">190</span><a name="link190"
      id="link190"></a>possessed for their worshippers a phallic significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain writers have further endeavoured to show that a few animal-gods
      entered into the early worship of the Hebrews. I do not feel sure that
      their arguments are convincing; but for the sake of completeness I include
      the two most probable cases in this brief review of the vague and elusive
      deities of early Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these is the god in the form of a young bull, specially worshipped
      at Dan and Bethel, as the bull Apis was worshipped at Memphis, and the
      bull Mnevis at On or Heliopolis. This cult of the bull is pushed back in
      the later traditions to the period of the exodus, when the Israelites made
      themselves a &ldquo;golden calf&rdquo; in the wilderness. Kuenen, indeed,
      lays stress upon the point that this Semitic bull-worship differed
      essentially from the cult of Apis in the fact that it was directed to an
      image or idol, not to a living animal. This is true, and I certainly do
      not wish to press any particular connexion between Egypt and the golden
      bulls of Jeroboam in the cities of Ephraim: though I think too much may
      perhaps be made of superficial differences and too little of deep-seated
      resemblances in these matters, seeing that bull-worship is a common
      accompaniment of a phallic cult in the whole wide district between Egypt
      and India. It is the tendency of the scholastic mind, indeed, to
      over-elaborate trifles, and to multiply to excess minute distinctions. But
      in any case, we are on comparatively safe ground in saying that a bull-god
      was an object of worship in Israel down to a very late period; that his
      cult descended from an early age of the national existence; and that the
      chief seats of his images were at Dan and Bethel in Ephraim, and at
      Beersheba in Judah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this bull-shaped deity Jahweh&rsquo; himself, or one of the
      polymorphic forms of Jahweh? Such is the opinion of Kuenen, who says
      explicitly, &ldquo;Jahweh was worshipped in the shape of a young bull. It
      cannot be doubted that the <span class="pagenum">191</span><a
      name="link191" id="link191"></a>cult of the bull-calf was really the cult
      of Jahweh in person.&rdquo; And certainly in the prophetic writings of the
      eighth century, we can clearly descry that the worshippers of the bull
      regarded themselves as worshipping the god Jahweh, who brought up his
      people from the land of Egypt. Nevertheless, dangerous as it may seem for
      an outsider to differ on such a subject from great Semitic scholars, I
      venture to think we may see reason hereafter to conclude that this was not
      originally the case: that the god worshipped under the form of the
      bull-calf was some other deity, like the Molech whom we know to have been
      represented with a bull&rsquo;s head; and that only by the later syncretic
      process did this bull-god come to be identified in the end with Jahweh, a
      deity (as seems likely) of quite different origin, much as Mnevis came to
      be regarded at Heliopolis as an incarnation of Ra, and as Apis came to be
      regarded at Memphis as an avatar of Ptah and still later of Osiris. On the
      other hand, we must remember that, as Mr. Frazer has shown, a sacred
      animal is often held to be the representative and embodiment of the very
      god to whom it is habitually sacrificed. Here again we trench on ground
      which can only satisfactorily be occupied at a later stage of our
      polymorphic argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second animal-god, apparently, also adored in the form of a metal image,
      was the asp or snake, known in our version as &ldquo;the brazen serpent,&rdquo;
      and connected by the Jehovistic editors of the earlier traditions with
      Moses in the wilderness. The name of this deity is given us in the Book of
      Kings as Nehushtan, &ldquo;the brass god&rdquo;; but whether this was
      really its proper designation or a mere contemptuous descriptive title we
      can hardly be certain. The worship of the serpent is said to have gone on
      uninterruptedly till the days of Hezekiah, when, under the influence of
      the exclusive devotion to Jahweh which was then becoming popular, the
      image was broken in pieces as an idolatrous object. It is scarcely
      necessary to point out in passing that the asp was one of the most sacred
      animals <span class="pagenum">192</span><a name="link192" id="link192"></a>in
      Egypt: but, as in the case of the bull, the snake was also a widespread
      object of worship throughout all the surrounding countries; and it is
      therefore probable that the Hebrew snake-worship may have been parallel
      to, rather than derived from, Egyptian ophiolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, then, seen through the dim veil of Jehovism, are the misty features
      of that uncertain pantheon in which, about the eighth century at least,
      Jahweh found himself the most important deity. The most important, I say,
      because it is clear from our records that for many ages the worship of
      Jahweh and the worship of the Baalim went on side by side without
      conscious rivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what sort of god was this holy Jahweh himself, whom the Hebrews
      recognised from a very early time as emphatically and above all others
      &ldquo;the God of Israel&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever he was envisaged as a golden bull, if ever he was regarded as the
      god of light, fire, or the sun, those concepts, I believe, must have been
      the result of a late transference of attributes and confusion of persons,
      such as we may see so rife in the more recent mystical religion of Egypt.
      What in his own nature Jahweh must have been in the earliest days of his
      nascent godhead I believe we can best judge by putting together some of
      the passages in old traditionary legend which bear most plainly upon his
      character and functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the legendary account of the earliest dealings of Jahweh with the
      Hebrew race, we are told that the ethnical god appeared to Abraham in
      Haran, and promised to make of him &ldquo;a great nation.&rdquo; Later on,
      Abraham complains of the want of an heir, saying to Jahweh, &ldquo;Thou
      hast given me no seed.&rdquo; Then Jahweh &ldquo;brought him forth abroad,
      and said, Look now toward heaven and tell the stars: so shall thy seed be.&rdquo;
      Over and over again we get similar promises of fruitfulness made to
      Abraham: &ldquo;I will multiply thee exceedingly&rdquo;; &ldquo;thou shalt
      be a father of many nations&rdquo;; &ldquo;I will make thee exceeding
      fruitful&rdquo;; &ldquo;kings shall come out of thee&rdquo;; &ldquo;for a
      father of many nations <span class="pagenum">193</span><a name="link193"
      id="link193"></a>have I made thee.&rdquo; So, too, of Sarah: &ldquo;she
      shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.&rdquo; And
      of Ishmael: &ldquo;I have blessed him and will make him fruitful, and will
      multiply him exceedingly: twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make
      him a great nation.&rdquo; Time after time these blessings recur for
      Abraham, Isaac, and all his family: &ldquo;I will multiply thy seed as the
      stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy
      seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In every one of these passages, and in many more which need not be quoted,
      but which will readily occur to every reader, Jahweh is represented
      especially as a god of increase, of generation, of populousness, of
      fertility. As such, too, we find him frequently and markedly worshipped on
      special occasions. He was the god to whom sterile women prayed, and from
      whom they expected the special blessing of a son, to keep up the cult of
      the family ancestors. This trait survived even into the poetry of the
      latest period. &ldquo;He maketh the barren woman to keep house,&rdquo;
      says a psalmist about Jahweh, &ldquo;and to be a joyful mother of
      children.&rdquo; And from the beginning to the end of Hebrew legend we
      find a similar characteristic of the ethnical god amply vindicated. When
      Sarah is old and well stricken in years, Jahweh visits her and she
      conceives Isaac. Then Isaac in turn &ldquo;intreated Jahweh for his wife,
      because she was barren; and Jahweh was intreated of him, and Rebekah his
      wife conceived.&rdquo; Again, &ldquo;when Jahweh saw that Leah was hated,
      he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.&rdquo; Once more, of the birth
      of Samson we are told that Manoah&rsquo;s wife &ldquo;was barren and bare
      not&rdquo;: but &ldquo;the angel of Jahweh appeared unto the woman and
      said unto her, Behold, now thou art barren and bearest not; but thou shalt
      conceive and bear a son.&rdquo; And of Hannah we are told, even more
      significantly, that Jahweh had &ldquo;shut up her womb.&rdquo; At the
      shrine of Jahweh at Shiloh, therefore, she prayed to Jahweh that this
      disgrace might be removed from her and that a child might <span
      class="pagenum">194</span><a name="link194" id="link194"></a>be born to
      her. If she bore &ldquo;a man child,&rdquo; she would offer him up all his
      life long as an anchorite to Jahweh, to be a Nazarite of the Lord, an
      ascetic and a fanatic. &ldquo;Jahweh remembered her,&rdquo; and she bore
      Samuel. And after that again, &ldquo;Jahweh visited Hannah, so that she
      conceived and bare three sons and two daughters.&rdquo; In many other
      passages we get the self-same trait: Jahweh is regarded above everything
      as a god of increase and a giver of offspring. &ldquo;Children are a
      heritage from Jahweh,&rdquo; says the much later author of a familiar ode:
      &ldquo;the fruit of the womb are a reward from him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear, too, that this desire for children, for a powerful clan, for
      the increase of the people, was a dominant one everywhere in Ephraim and
      in Judah. &ldquo;Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine,&rdquo; says Jahweh
      to his votary by the mouth of the poet; &ldquo;thy children like olive
      plants round about thy table.&rdquo; &ldquo;Happy is the man that hath his
      quiver full of them,&rdquo; says another psalmist; &ldquo;they shall speak
      with the enemies in the gate.&rdquo; Again and again the promise is
      repeated that the seed of Abraham or of Joseph or of Ishmael shall be
      numerous as the stars of heaven or the sands of the sea: Jahweh&rsquo;s
      chief prerogative is evidently the gift of increase, extended often to
      cattle and asses, but always including at least sons and daughters. If
      Israel obeys Jahweh, says the Deuteronomist, &ldquo;Jahweh will make thee
      plenteous for good in the fruit of thy belly, and in the fruit of thy
      cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground&rdquo;: but if otherwise, then
      &ldquo;cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land,
      the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, elsewhere throughout the world we find in like manner a certain class
      of phallic gods who are specially conceived as givers of fertility, and to
      whom prayers and offerings are made by barren women who desire children.
      And the point to observe is that these gods are usually (perhaps one might
      even say always) embodied in stone pillars <span class="pagenum">195</span><a
      name="link195" id="link195"></a>or upright monoliths. The practical great
      god of India&mdash;the god whom the people really worship&mdash;is
      Mahadeo; and Mahadeo is, as we know, a cylinder of stone, to whom the <i>linga
      puja</i> is performed, and to whom barren women pray for offspring. There
      are sacred stones in western Europe, now crowned by a cross, at which
      barren women still pray to God and the Madonna, or to some local saint,
      for the blessing of children. It is allowed that while the obelisk is from
      one point of view (in later theory) a ray of the sun, it is from another
      point of view (in earlier origin) a &ldquo;symbol of the generative power
      of nature,&rdquo;&mdash;which is only another way of saying that it is an
      ancestral stone of phallic virtue. In short, without laying too much
      stress upon the connexion, we may conclude generally that the upright
      pillar came early to be regarded, not merely as a memento of the dead and
      an abode of the ghost or indwelling god, but also in some mysterious and
      esoteric way as a representative of the male and generative principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we recollect that the stone pillar was often identified with the
      ancestor or father, the reason for this idea will not perhaps be quite so
      hard to understand. &ldquo;From these stones we are all descended,&rdquo;
      thinks the primitive worshipper: &ldquo;these are our fathers; therefore,
      they are the givers of children, the producers and begetters of all our
      generations, the principle of fertility, the proper gods to whom to pray
      for offspring.&rdquo; Add that many of them, being represented as human,
      or human in their upper part at least, grow in time to be ithyphallic,
      like Priapus, party by mere grotesque barbarism, but partly also as a sign
      of the sex of the deceased: and we can see the naturalness of this easy
      transition. From the Hermæ of the Greeks to the rude phallic deities of so
      many existing savage races, we get everywhere signs of this constant
      connexion between the sacred stone and the idea of paternity. Where the
      stone represents the grave of a woman, the deity of course is conceived as
      a goddess, but with <span class="pagenum">196</span><a name="link196"
      id="link196"></a>the same implications. Herodotus saw in Syria stelæ
      engraved with the female pudenda. The upright stone god is thus everywhere
      and always liable to be regarded as a god of fruitfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But did this idea of the stone pillar extend to Palestine and to the
      Semitic nations? There is evidence that it did, besides that of Herodotus.
      Major Conder, whose opinion on all questions of pure archaeology (as
      opposed to philology) deserves the highest respect, says of Canaanitish
      times, &ldquo;The menhir, or conical stone, was the emblem throughout
      Syria of the gods presiding over fertility, and the cup hollows which have
      been formed in menhirs and dolmens are the indications of libations, often
      of human blood, once poured on these stones by early worshippers.&rdquo;
      He connects these monuments with the linga cult of India, and adds that
      Dr. Chaplin has found such a cult still surviving near the Sea of Galilee.
      Lucian speaks of the two great pillars at the temple of Hierapolis as <i>phalli</i>.
      Of the Phoenicians Major Conder writes: &ldquo;The chief emblem worshipped
      in the temples was a pillar or cone, derived no doubt from the rude
      menhirs which were worshipped by early savage tribes, such as Dravidians,
      Arabs, Celts, and Hottentots.&rdquo; That they were originally sepulchral
      in character we can gather from the fact that &ldquo;they often stood
      beneath trilithons or dolmens, or were placed before an altar made by a
      stone laid flat on an upright base.&rdquo; &ldquo;The representations on
      early Babylonian cylinders of tables whereon a small fire might be
      kindled, or an offering of some small object laid, seem to indicate a
      derivation from similar structures. The original temple in which the cone
      and its shrine, or its altar, were placed, was but a cromlech or
      enclosure, square or round, made by setting up stones.&rdquo; Remains of
      such enclosures, with dolmens on one side, are found at various spots in
      Moab and Phoenicia. Nothing could be more obviously sepulchral in
      character than these rude shrines or Gilgals, with the pillar or
      gravestone, from which, as Major Conder suggests, <span class="pagenum">197</span><a
      name="link197" id="link197"></a>the hypæthral temples of Byblos and
      Baalbek are finally developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Jahweh himself in his earliest form was such a stone god, the
      evidence, I think, though not perhaps exactly conclusive, is to say the
      least extremely suggestive. I have already called attention to it in a
      previous chapter, and need not here recapitulate it in full; but a few
      stray additions may not be without value. Besides the general probability,
      among a race whose gods were so almost universally represented by sacred
      stones, that any particular god, unless the contrary be proved, was so
      represented, there is the evidence of all the later language, and of the
      poems written after the actual stone god himself had perished, that Jahweh
      was still popularly regarded as, at least in a metaphorical sense, a stone
      or rock. &ldquo;He is the Rock,&rdquo; says the Deuteronomist, in the song
      put into the mouth of Moses; &ldquo;I will publish the name of Jahweh;
      ascribe greatness unto our god.&rdquo; &ldquo;Jahweh liveth, and blessed
      be my rock,&rdquo; says the hymn which a later writer composes for David
      in the Second Book of Samuel: &ldquo;exalted be the god of the rock of my
      salvation.&rdquo; And in the psalms the image recurs again and again:
      &ldquo;Jahweh is my rock and my fortress&rdquo;; &ldquo;Who is a god save
      Jahweh, and who is a rock save our god?&rdquo;; &ldquo;He set my feet upon
      a rock, and established my goings&rdquo;; &ldquo;Lead me to the rock that
      is greater than I&rdquo;; &ldquo;Jahweh is my defence, and my god is the
      rock of my refuge&rdquo;; &ldquo;O come, let us sing to Jahweh; let us
      make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.&rdquo; And that the
      shape of this stone was probably that of a rounded pillar, bevelled at the
      top, we see in the fact that later ages pictured to themselves their
      transfigured Jahweh as leading the Sons of Israel in the wilderness as a
      pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by daytime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earlier Israelites, however, had no such poetical illusions. To them,
      their god Jahweh was simply the object&mdash;stone pillar or otherwise&mdash;preserved
      in the ark or chest <span class="pagenum">198</span><a name="link198"
      id="link198"></a>which long rested at Shiloh, and which was afterwards
      enshrined, &ldquo;between the thighs of the building&rdquo; (as a later
      gloss has it), in the Temple at Jerusalem. The whole of the early
      traditions embedded in the books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings show us
      quite clearly that Jahweh himself was then regarded as inhabiting the ark,
      and as carried about with it from place to place in all its wanderings.
      The story of the battle with the Philistines at Eben-ezer, the fall of
      Dagon before the rival god, the fortunes of the ark after its return to
      the Israelitish people, the removal to Jerusalem by David, the final
      enthronement by Solomon, all distinctly show that Jahweh in person dwelt
      within the ark, between the guardian cherubim. &ldquo;Who is able to stand
      before the face of Jahweh, this very sacred god?&rdquo; ask the men of
      Bethshemesh, when they ventured to look inside that hallowed abode, and
      were smitten down by the &ldquo;jealous god&rdquo; who loved to live in
      the darkness of the inmost sanctuary. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mr. William Simpson has some excellent remarks on the
     analogies of the Egyptian and Hebrew arks and sanctuaries in
     his pamphlet on The Worship of Death.
</pre>
    <p>
      It may be well to note in this connexion two significant facts: Just such
      an ark was used in Egypt to contain the sacred objects or images of the
      gods. And further, at the period when the Sons of Israel were tributaries
      in Egypt, a Theban dynasty ruled the country, and the worship of the great
      Theban phallic deity, Khem, was widely spread throughout every part of the
      Egyptian dominions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there, however, any evidence of a linga or other stone pillar being
      ever thus enshrined and entempled as the great god of a sanctuary?
      Clearly, Major Conder has already supplied some, and more is forthcoming
      from various other sources. The cone which represented Aphrodite in Cyprus
      was similarly enshrined as the chief object of a temple, as were the stelæ
      of all Egyptian mummies. &ldquo;The trilithon,&rdquo; says Major Conder,
      &ldquo;becomes later a shrine, in which the cone or a statue stands.&rdquo;
      The significance <span class="pagenum">199</span><a name="link199"
      id="link199"></a>of this correlation will at once be seen if the reader
      remembers how, in the chapter on Sacred Stones, I showed the origin of the
      idol from the primitive menhir or upright pillar. &ldquo;The Khonds and
      other non-Aryan tribes in India,&rdquo; says Conder once more, &ldquo;build
      such temples of rude stones, daubed with red,&mdash;a survival of the old
      practice of anointing the menhirs and the sacred cone or pillar with blood
      of victims, sometimes apparently human. Among the Indians, the pillar is a
      lingam, and such apparently was its meaning among the Phoenicians.&rdquo;
      And in the Greek cities we know from Pausanias that an unhewn stone was
      similarly enshrined in the most magnificent adytum of the noblest Hellenic
      temples. In fact, it was rather the rule than otherwise that a stone was
      the chief object of worship in the noblest fanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more curious trait must be noted in the worship of Jahweh. Not only
      did he rejoice in human sacrifices, but he also demanded especially an
      offering of the firstborn, and he required a singular and significant
      ransom from every man-child whom he permitted to live among his peculiar
      votaries. On the fact of human sacrifices I need hardly insist: they were
      an integral part of all Semitic worship, and their occurrence in the cult
      of Jahweh has been universally allowed by all unprejudiced scholars. The
      cases of Agag, whom Samuel hewed to pieces before the face of Jahweh, and
      of Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter, whom her father offered up as a
      thank-offering for his victory, though not of course strictly historical
      from a critical point of view, are quite sufficient evidence to show the
      temper and the habit of the Jahweh-worshippers who described them. So with
      the legend of the offering of Isaac, who is merely rescued at the last
      moment in order that the god of generation may make him the father of many
      thousands. Again, David seeks to pacify the anger of Jahweh by a sacrifice
      of seven of the sons of Saul. And the prophet Micah asks, &ldquo;Shall I
      give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin
      of my soul?&rdquo;&mdash;a passage <span class="pagenum">200</span><a
      name="link200" id="link200"></a>which undoubtedly implies that in Micah&rsquo;s
      time such a sacrifice of the eldest child was a common incident of current
      Jahweh-worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      From human sacrifice to circumcision the transition is less violent than
      would at first sight appear. An intermediate type is found in the
      dedication of the first-born, where Jahweh seems to claim for himself, not
      as a victim, but as a slave and devotee, the first fruits of that increase
      which it is his peculiar function to ensure. In various laws, Jahweh lays
      claim to the first-born of man and beast,&mdash;sometimes to all,
      sometimes only to the male first-born. The animals were sacrificed; the
      sons, in later ages at least, were either made over as Nazarites or
      redeemed with an offering or a money-ransom. But we cannot doubt that in
      the earliest times the first-born child was slain before Jahweh. In the
      curious legend of Moses and Zipporah we get a strange folk-tale connecting
      this custom indirectly with the practice of circumcision. Jahweh seeks to
      kill Moses, apparently because he has not offered up his child: but
      Zipporah his wife takes a stone knife, circumcises her son, and flings the
      bloody offering at Jahweh&rsquo;s feet, who thereupon lets her husband go.
      This, rather than the later account of its institution by Abraham, seems
      the true old explanatory legend of the origin of circumcision&mdash;a
      legend analogous to those which we find in Roman and other early history
      as embodying or explaining certain ancient customs or legal formulae.
      Circumcision, in fact, appears to be a bloody sacrifice to Jahweh, as the
      god of generation: a sacrifice essentially of the nature of a ransom, and
      therefore comparable to all those other bodily mutilations whose origin
      Mr. Herbert Spencer has so well shown in the <i>Ceremonial Institutions</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, the nature of the offering helps to cast light upon the
      character of Jahweh as a god of increase; exactly as the &ldquo;emerods&rdquo;
      with which the Philistines were afflicted for the capture of Jahweh and
      his ark show <span class="pagenum">201</span><a name="link201" id="link201"></a>the
      nature of the vengeance which might naturally be expected from a deity of
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last of all, how is it that later Hebrew writers believed the object
      concealed in the ark to have been, not a phallic stone, but a copy of the
      &ldquo;Ten Words&rdquo; which Jahweh was fabled to have delivered to
      Moses? That would be difficult to decide: but here at least is an aperçu
      upon the subject which I throw out for what it may be worth. The later
      Hebrews, when their views of Jahweh had grown expanded and etherealised,
      were obviously ashamed of their old stone-worship, if indeed they were
      archaeologists enough after the captivity to know that it had ever really
      existed. What more natural, then, than for them to suppose that the stone
      which they heard of as having been enclosed in the ark was a copy of the
      &ldquo;Ten Words,&rdquo;&mdash;the covenant of Jahweh? Hence, perhaps, the
      later substitution of the term, &ldquo;Ark of the Covenant,&rdquo; for the
      older and correcter phrase, &ldquo;Ark of Jahweh.&rdquo; One more
      suggestion, still more purely hypothetical. Cones with pyramidal heads,
      bearing inscriptions to the deceased, were used by the Phoenicians for
      interments. It is just possible that the original Jahweh may have been
      such an ancient pillar, covered with writings of some earlier character,
      which were interpreted later as the equivalents or symbols of the &ldquo;Ten
      Words.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting all the evidence together, then, as far as we can now recover it,
      and interpreting it on broad anthropological lines by analogy from
      elsewhere, I should say the following propositions seem fairly probable:
    </p>
    <p>
      The original religion of Israel was a mixed polytheism, containing many
      various types of gods, and based like all other religions upon domestic
      and tribal ancestor-worship. Some of the gods were of animal shapes:
      others were more or less vaguely anthropomorphic. But the majority were
      worshipped under the form of sacred stones, trees, or wooden cones. The
      greater part of these gods were Semitic in type, and common to the Sons of
      Israel with their neighbours <span class="pagenum">202</span><a
      name="link202" id="link202"></a>and kinsmen. The character of the Hebrew
      worship, however, apparently underwent some slight modification in Egypt;
      or at any rate, Egyptian influences led to the preference of certain gods
      over others at the period of the Exodus. One god, in particular, Jahweh by
      name, seems to have been almost peculiar to the Sons of Israel,&mdash;their
      ethnical deity, and therefore in all probability an early tribal ancestor
      or the stone representative of such an ancestor. The legends are probably
      right in their implication that this god was already worshipped (not of
      course exclusively) by the Sons of Israel before their stay in Egypt; they
      are almost certainly correct in ascribing the great growth and extension
      of his cult to the period of the Exodus. The Sons of Israel, at least from
      the date of the Exodus onward, carried this god or his rude image with
      them in an ark or box through all their wanderings. The object so carried
      was probably a conical stone pillar, which we may conjecture to have been
      the grave-stone of some deified ancestor: and of this ancestor &ldquo;Jahweh&rdquo;
      was perhaps either the proper name or a descriptive epithet. Even if, as
      Colenso suggests, the name itself was Canaanitish, and belonged already to
      a local god, its application to the sacred stone of the ark would be
      merely another instance of the common tendency to identify the gods of one
      race or country with those of another. The stone itself was always
      enshrouded in Egyptian mystery, and no private person was permitted to
      behold it. Sacrifices, both human and otherwise, were offered up to it, as
      to the other gods, its fellow&rsquo;s and afterwards its hated rivals. The
      stone, like other sacred stones of pillar shape, was regarded as
      emblematic of the generative power. Circumcision was a mark of devotion to
      Jahweh, at first, no doubt, either voluntary, or performed by way of a
      ransom, but becoming with the growth and exclusiveness of Jahweh-worship a
      distinctive rite of Jahweh&rsquo;s chosen people. (But other Semites also
      circumcised <span class="pagenum">203</span><a name="link203" id="link203"></a>themselves
      as a blood-offering to their own more or less phallic deities.)
    </p>
    <p>
      More briefly still, among many Hebrew gods, Jahweh was originally but a
      single one, a tribal ancestor-god, worshipped in the form of a cylindrical
      stone, perhaps at first a grave-stone, and regarded as essentially a god
      of increase, a special object of veneration by childless women.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this rude ethnical divinity, the mere sacred pillar of a barbarous
      tribe, was gradually developed the Lord God of later Judaism and of
      Christianity&mdash;a power, eternal, omniscient, almighty, holy; the most
      ethereal, the most sublime, the most superhuman deity that the brain of
      man has ever conceived. By what slow evolutionary process of syncretism
      and elimination, of spiritual mysticism and national enthusiasm, of
      ethical effort and imaginative impulse that mighty God was at last
      projected out of so unpromising an original it will be the task of our
      succeeding chapters to investigate and to describe.

      that the Hebrews were originally polytheists, and that their ethnical god
      Jahweh seems to have been worshipped by them in early times under the
      material form of a cylindrical stone pillar. Or rather, to speak more
      naturally, the object they so worshipped they regarded as a god, and
      called Jahweh. The question next confronts us, how from this humble
      beginning did Israel attain to the pure monotheism of its later age? What
      was there in the position or conditions of the Hebrew race which made the
      later Jews reject all their other gods, and fabricate out of their early
      national Sacred Stone the most sublime, austere, and omnipotent deity that
      humanity has known?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer, I believe, to this pregnant question is partly to be found in
      a certain general tendency of the Semitic mind; partly in the peculiar
      political and social state of the Israelitish tribes during the ninth,
      eighth, seventh, sixth, and fifth centuries before the Christian era. Or,
      to put the proposed solution of the problem, beforehand, in a still
      simpler form, Hebrew monotheism was to some extent the result of a
      syncretic treatment of all the gods, in the course of which the attributes
      and characters of each became merged in the other, only the names (if
      anything) remaining distinct; and to some extent the result of the intense
      national patriotism, of which the ethnical god Jahweh was at once the
      outcome, the expression, and the fondest hope. The belief that Jahweh
      fought for Israel, <span class="pagenum">205</span><a name="link205"
      id="link205"></a>and that by trust in Jahweh alone could Israel hold her
      own against Egypt and Assyria, wildly fanatical as it appears to us
      to-day, and utterly disproved by all the facts of the case as it
      ultimately was, nevertheless formed a central idea of the Hebrew patriots,
      and resulted by slow degrees in the firm establishment first of an
      exclusive, and afterwards of a truly monotheistic Jahweh-cult.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of Ernest Renan&rsquo;s brilliant paradoxes that the Semitic
      mind is naturally monotheistic. As a matter of fact, the Semitic mind has
      shown this native tendency in its first stages by everywhere evolving
      pretty much the same polytheistic pantheon as that evolved by every other
      group of human beings everywhere. Nevertheless, there is perhaps this
      kernel of truth in Renan&rsquo;s paradoxical contention; the Semites, more
      readily than most other people, merge the features of their deities one in
      the other. That is not, indeed, by any means an exclusive Semitic trait.
      We saw already, in dealing with the Egyptian religion, how all the forms
      and functions of the gods faded at last into an inextricable mixture, an
      olla podrida of divinity, from which it was practically impossible to
      disentangle with certainty the original personalities of Ra and Turn, of
      Amen and Osiris, of Neith and Isis, of Ptah and Apis. Even in the
      relatively fixed and individualised pantheon of Hellas, it occurs often
      enough that confusions both of person and prerogative obscure the
      distinctness of the various gods. Aphrodite and Herakles are polymorphic
      in their embodiments. But in the Semitic religions, at least in that later
      stage where we first come across them, the lineaments of the different
      deities are so blurred and indefinite that hardly anything more than mere
      names can with certainty be recognised. No other gods are so shadowy and
      so vague. The type of this pantheon is that dim figure of El-Shaddai, the
      early and terrible object of Hebrew worship, of whose attributes and
      nature we know positively nothing, but who stands in the background of all
      Hebrew thought as the embodiment of the nameless <span class="pagenum">206</span><a
      name="link206" id="link206"></a>and trembling dread begotten on man&rsquo;s
      soul by the irresistible and ruthless forces of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vagueness and shadowiness of the Semitic religious conceptions seems
      to depend to some extent upon the inartistic nature of the Semitic
      culture. The Semite seldom carved the image of his god. Roman observers
      noted with surprise that the shrine of Carmel contained no idol. But it
      depended also upon deep-seated characteristics of the Semitic race.
      Melancholy, contemplative, proud, reserved, but strangely fanciful, the
      Arab of to-day perhaps gives us the clue to the indefinite nature of early
      Semitic religious thinking. There never was anether world more ghostly
      than Sheol; there never were gods more dimly awful than the Elohim who
      float through the early stories of the Hebrew mystical cycle. Their very
      names are hardly known to us: they come to us through the veil of later
      Jehovistic editing with such merely descriptive titles as the God of
      Abraham, the Terror of Isaac, the Mighty Power, the Most High Deity.
      Indeed, the true Hebrew, like many other barbarians, seems to have shrunk
      either from looking upon the actual form of his god itself, or from
      pronouncing aloud his proper name. His deity was shrouded in the darkness
      of an ark or the deep gloom of an inner tent or sanctuary; the syllables
      that designated the object of his worship were never uttered in full, save
      on the most solemn occasions, but were shirked or slurred over by some
      descriptive epithet. Even the unpronounceable title of Jahweh itself
      appears from our documents to have been a later name bestowed during the
      Exodus on an antique god: while the rival titles of the Baal and the
      Molech mean nothing more than the Lord and the King respectively. An
      excessive reverence forbade the Semite to know anything of his god&rsquo;s
      personal appearance or true name, and so left the features of almost all
      the gods equally uncertain and equally formless.
    </p>
    <p>
      But besides the difficulty of accurately distinguishing between the forms
      and functions of the different Semitic deities <span class="pagenum">207</span><a
      name="link207" id="link207"></a>which even their votaries must have felt
      from the beginning, there was a superadded difficulty in the developed
      creed, due to the superposition of elemental mysticism and nature-worship
      upon the primitive cult of ancestral ghosts as gods and goddesses. Just as
      Ra, the sun, was identified in the latest ages with almost every Egyptian
      god, so solar ideas and solar myths affected at last the distinct
      personality of almost every Semitic deity. The consequence is that all the
      gods become in the end practically indistinguishable: one is so like the
      other that different interpreters make the most diverse identifications,
      and are apparently justified in so doing (from the mythological
      standpoint) by the strong solar or elemental family likeness which runs
      through the whole pantheon in its later stages. It has even been doubted
      by scholars of the older school whether Jahweh is not himself a form of
      his great rival Baal: whether both were not at bottom identical&mdash;mere
      divergent shapes of one polyonymous sun-god. To us, who recognise in every
      Baal the separate ghost-god of a distinct tomb, such identification is
      clearly impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the worshippers of the Baalim or of Jahweh themselves, however, these
      abstruser mythological problems never presented themselves. The difference
      of name and of holy place was quite enough for them, in spite of essential
      identity of attribute or nature. They would kill one another for the sake
      of a descriptive epithet, or risk death itself rather than offer up
      sacrifices at a hostile altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, various influences conspired, here as elsewhere, to bring
      about a gradual movement of syncretism&mdash;that is to say, of the
      absorption of many distinct gods into one; the final identification of
      several deities originally separate. What those influences were we must
      now briefly consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, we must recollect that while in Egypt, with its dry
      and peculiarly preservative climate, mummies, idols, tombs, and temples
      might be kept unchanged and undestroyed <span class="pagenum">208</span><a
      name="link208" id="link208"></a>for ages, in almost all other countries
      rain, wind, and time are mighty levellers of human handicraft. Thus, while
      in Egypt the cult of the Dead Ancestor survives as such quite confessedly
      and openly for many centuries, in most other countries the tendency is for
      the actual personal objects of worship to be more and more forgotten;
      vague gods and spirits usurp by degrees the place of the historic man;
      rites at last cling rather to sites than to particular persons. The tomb
      may disappear; and yet the sacred stone may be reverenced still with the
      accustomed veneration. The sacred stone may go; and yet the sacred tree
      may be watered yearly with the blood of victims. The tree itself may die;
      and yet the stump may continue to be draped on its anniversary with festal
      apparel. The very stump may decay; and yet gifts of food or offerings of
      rags may be cast as of old into the sacred spring that once welled beside
      it. The locality thus grows to be holy in itself, and gives us one clear
      and obvious source of later nature-worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gods or spirits who haunt such shrines come naturally to be thought of
      with the lapse of ages as much like one another. Godship is all that can
      long remain of their individual attributes. Their very names are often
      unknown; they are remembered merely as the lord of Lebanon, the Baal of
      Mount Peor. No wonder that after a time they get to be practically
      identified with one another, while similar myths are often fastened by
      posterity to many of them together. Indeed, we know that new names, and
      even foreign intrusive names, frequently take the place of the original
      titles, while the god himself still continues to be worshipped as the same
      shapeless stone, with the same prescribed rites, in the same squalid or
      splendid temples. Thus, Melcarth, the Baal of Tyre, was adored in later
      days under the Greek name of Herakles; and thus at Bablos two local
      deities, after being identified first with the Syrian divinities, Adonis
      and Astarte, were identified later with the Egyptian divinities, Osiris
      and Isis. <span class="pagenum">209</span><a name="link209" id="link209"></a>Yet
      the myths of the place show us that through all that time the true worship
      was paid to the dead stump of a sacred tree, which was said to have grown
      from the grave of a god&mdash;in other words, from the tumulus of an
      ancient chieftain. No matter how greatly mythologies change, these local
      cults remain ever constant; the sacred stones are here described as
      haunted by djinns, and there as memorials of Christian martyrs; the holy
      wells are dedicated here to nymph or hero, and receive offerings there to
      saint or fairy. So the holy oaks of immemorial worship in England become
      &ldquo;Thor&rsquo;s oaks&rdquo; under Saxon heathendom, and &ldquo;Gospel
      oaks&rdquo; under mediaeval Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in the latest stages of worship, an attempt is always made to
      work in the heavenly bodies and the great energies of nature into the
      mythological groundwork or theory of religion. Every king is the
      descendant of the sun, and every great god is therefore necessarily the
      sun in person. Endless myths arise from these phrases, which are mistaken
      by mythologists for the central facts and sources of religion. But they
      are nothing of the kind. Mysticism and symbolism can never be primitive;
      they are well-meant attempts by cultivated religious thinkers of later
      days to read deep-seated meaning into the crude ideas and still cruder
      practices of traditional religion. I may add that Dr. Robertson Smith&rsquo;s
      learned and able works are constantly spoiled in this way by his dogged
      determination to see nature-worship as primitive, where it is really
      derivative, as the earliest starting-point, where it is really the highest
      and latest development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly, when all gods have come to be more or less solar in their
      external and acquired features, the process of identification and
      internationalisation is proportionately easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The syncretism thus brought about in the Hebrew religion by the
      superposition of nature-worship on the primitive cult must have paved the
      way for the later recognition of <span class="pagenum">210</span><a
      name="link210" id="link210"></a>monotheism, exactly as we know it did in
      the esoteric creed of Egypt, by making all the gods so much alike that
      worshippers had only to change the name of their deity, not the attributes
      of the essential conception. Let us look first how far this syncretism
      affected the later idea of Jahweh, the phallic stone-god preserved in the
      ark; and then let us enquire afterward how the patriotic reaction against
      Assyrian aggression put the final coping-stone on the rising fabric of
      monotheistic Jahweh-worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is often asserted that Jahweh was worshipped in many places in Israel
      under the form of a golden calf. That is to say, Hebrews who set up images
      of a metal bull believed themselves nevertheless to be worshipping Jahweh.
      Even the prophets of the eighth century regard the cult of the bull as a
      form of Jahweh-worship, though not a form to which they can personally
      give their approbation. But the bull is probably in its origin a distinct
      god from the stone in the ark; and if its worship was identified with that
      of the Rock of Israel, it could be only by a late piece of syncretic
      mysticism. Perhaps the link here, as in the case of Apis, was a priestly
      recognition of the bull as symbolising the generative power of nature; an
      idea which would be peculiarly appropriate to the god whose great function
      it was to encourage fruitfulness. But in any case, we cannot but see in
      this later calf-worship a superadded element wholly distinct from the
      older cult of the sacred stone, just as the worship of Ra was wholly
      distinct in origin from the totem-cult of Mnevis, or as the worship of
      Amen was wholly distinct from that of Khem and Osiris. The stone-god and
      the bull-god merge at last into one, much as at a far later date the man
      Jesus merges into the Hebrew god, and receives more reverence in modern
      faiths than the older deity whom he practically replaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the Temple at Jerusalem itself, symbols of bull-worship were
      apparently admitted. The altar upon which the daily sacrifice was burnt
      had four horns; and the laver <span class="pagenum">211</span><a
      name="link211" id="link211"></a>in the court, the &ldquo;brazen sea,&rdquo;
      was supported upon the figures of twelve oxen. When we remember that the
      Molech had the head of a bull, we can hardly fail to see in these symbols
      a token of that gradual syncretism which invariably affects all developed
      pantheons in all civilised countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more important are the supposed signs of the later identification of
      Jahweh with the sun, and his emergence as a modified and transfigured
      sun-god. It may seem odd at first that such a character could ever be
      acquired by a sacred stone, did we not recollect the exactly similar
      history of the Egyptian obelisk, which in like manner represents, first
      and foremost, the upright pillar or monolith&mdash;that is to say, the
      primitive gravestone&mdash;but secondarily and derivatively, at once the
      generative principle and a ray of the sun. With this luminous analogy to
      guide us in our search, we shall have little difficulty in recognising how
      a solar character may have been given to the later attributes and
      descriptions of Jahweh.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not myself attach undue importance to these solar characteristics of
      the fully evolved Jahweh; but so much has been made of them by a certain
      school of modern thinkers that I must not pass them over in complete
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his early worshippers, then, as we saw, Jahweh was merely the stone in
      the ark. He dwelt there visibly, and where the ark went, there Jahweh went
      with it. But the later Hebrews&mdash;say in the eighth century&mdash;had
      acquired a very different idea of Jahweh&rsquo;s dwelling-place.
      Astrological and solar ideas (doubtless Akkadian in origin) had profoundly
      modified their rude primitive conceptions. To Amos and to the true Isaiah,
      Jahweh dwells in the open sky above and is &ldquo;Jahweh of hosts,&rdquo;
      the leader among the shining army of heaven, the king of the star-world.
      &ldquo;Over those celestial bodies and celestial inhabitants Jahweh rules&rdquo;;
      they surround him and execute his commands: <span class="pagenum">212</span><a
      name="link212" id="link212"></a>the host of heaven are his messengers&mdash;in
      the more familiar language of our modern religion, &ldquo;the angels of
      the Lord,&rdquo; the servants of Jahweh. To Micah, heaven is &ldquo;the
      temple of Jahweh&rsquo;s holiness&rdquo;: &ldquo;God on high,&rdquo; is
      the descriptive phrase by which the prophet alludes to him. In all this we
      have reached a very different conception indeed from that of the early and
      simple-minded Israelites who carried their god with them on an ox-cart
      from station to station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, light and fire are constantly regarded by these later
      thinkers as manifestations of Jahweh; and even in editing the earlier
      legends they introduce such newer ideas, making &ldquo;the glory of Jahweh&rdquo;
      light up the ark, or appear in the burning bush, or combining both views,
      the elder and the younger, in the pillar of fire that preceded the nomad
      horde of Israel in the wilderness. Jahweh is said to &ldquo;send&rdquo; or
      to &ldquo;cast fire&rdquo; from heaven, in which expressions we see once
      more the advanced concept of an elemental god, whose voice is the thunder,
      and whose weapon the lightning. All these are familiar developments of the
      chief god in a pantheon. Says Zechariah in his poem, &ldquo;Ask ye of
      Jahweh rain in the time of the latter showers: Jahweh will make the
      lightnings.&rdquo; Says Isaiah, &ldquo;The light of Israel shall be for a
      fire, And his holy one for a flame&rdquo;; &ldquo;Behold, the name of
      Jahweh cometh from afar, His anger burneth, and violently the smoke riseth
      on high: His lips are full of indignation, And his tongue is as a
      devouring fire.&rdquo; In these and a hundred other passages that might be
      quoted, we seem to see Jahweh envisaged to a great extent as a sun-god,
      and clothed in almost all the attributes of a fiery Molech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes these Molech-traits come very close indeed to those of the more
      generally acknowledged fire-gods. &ldquo;Thus we read,&rdquo; says Kuenen,
      &ldquo;that &lsquo;the glory of Jahweh was like devouring fire on the top
      of Mount Sinai&rsquo;; and that &lsquo;his angel appeared in a flame of
      fire out of the midst of a bush: the bush burned with fire but was not
      consumed.&rsquo;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">213</span><a name="link213"
      id="link213"></a>So Jahweh himself is called &ldquo;a consuming fire, a
      jealous god&rdquo;: and a poet thus describes his appearance, &ldquo;Smoke
      goeth up out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoureth; coals
      of fire are kindled by him.&rdquo; These are obviously very derivative and
      borrowed prerogatives with which to deck out the primitive stone pillar
      that led the people of Israel up out of Egypt. Yet we know that precisely
      analogous evolutions have been undergone by other stone-gods elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, though this is to anticipate a little, the later Jahweh-worship
      seems to have absorbed into itself certain astrological elements which
      were originally quite alien to it, belonging to the cult of other gods.
      Such for example is the institution of the Sabbath, the unlucky day of the
      malign god Kewân or Saturn, on which it was undesirable to do any kind of
      work, and on which accordingly the superstitious Semite rested altogether
      from his weekly labours. The division of the lunar month (the sacred
      period of Astarte, the queen of heaven) into four weeks of seven days
      each, dedicated in turn to the gods of the seven planets, belongs
      obviously to the same late cult of the elemental and astrological gods,
      or, rather, of the gods with whom these heavenly bodies were at last
      identified under Akkadian influence. The earlier prophets of the exclusive
      Jahweh-worship denounce as idolatrous such observation of the Sabbath and
      the astrological feasts&mdash;&ldquo;Your Sabbaths and your new moons are
      an abomination to me&rdquo;; and according to Amos, Kewân himself had been
      the chief idolatrous object of worship by his countrymen in the
      wilderness. Later on, however, the Jehovistic party found itself powerless
      to break the current of superstition on the Sabbath question, and a new <i>modus
      vivendi</i> was therefore necessary. They arranged a prudent compromise.
      The Sabbath was adopted bodily into the monotheistic Jahweh-worship, and a
      mythical reason was given for its institution and its sacred character
      which nominally linked it on to the cult of the ethnical god. On that day,
      said <span class="pagenum">214</span><a name="link214" id="link214"></a>the
      priestly cosmogonists, Jahweh rested from his labour of creation. In the
      same way, many other fragments of external cults were loosely attached to
      the worship of Jahweh by a verbal connection with some part of the revised
      Jehovistic legend, or else were accredited to national Jehovistic or
      Jehovised heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus briefly sketched out the gradual changes which the conception
      of Jahweh himself underwent during the ages when his supremacy was being
      slowly established in the confederacy of Israel, let us now hark back once
      more and attack the final problem, Why did the particular cult of Jahweh
      become at last exclusive and monotheistic?
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, we must remember that from the very outset of the national
      existence, Jahweh was clearly regarded on all hands as the <i>ethnical</i>
      god, the special god of Israel. The relation of such ethnical gods to
      their people has been admirably worked out by Dr. Robertson Smith in <i>The
      Religion of the Semites</i>. Even though we cannot, however, accept as
      historical the view given us of the exodus in the Pentateuch, nor admit
      that Jahweh played anything like so large a part in the great national
      migration as is there indicated, it is yet obvious that from the moment
      when Israel felt itself a nation at all, Jahweh was recognised as its
      chief deity. He was the &ldquo;god of Israel,&rdquo; just as Milcom was
      the god of the Ammonites, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Ashtaroth the
      goddess of Sidon. As distinctly as every Athenian, while worshipping Zeus
      and Hera and Apollo, held Athene to be the special patron of Athens, so
      did every Israelite, while worshipping the Baalim and the Molech and the
      local deities generally, hold Jahweh to be the special patron of Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, from the very beginning, there is reason to suppose that the
      Israelites regarded Jahweh as their supreme god. Most pantheons finally
      settle down into a recognised hierarchy, in which one deity or another
      gradually assumes the first place. So, in Hellas, the supremacy of Zeus
      was undoubted; so, in Rome, was the supremacy <span class="pagenum">215</span><a
      name="link215" id="link215"></a>of Jupiter. Sometimes, to be sure, as
      among our Teutonic ancestors, we see room for doubt between two rival
      gods: it would be difficult to assign the exact priority to either of the
      two leading deities: among the English, Woden rather bore it over Thunor;
      among the Scandinavians, Thor rather bore it over Odin. In Israel, in like
      manner, there was apparently a time when the Presidency of the Immortals
      hovered between Jahweh and one or other of the local Baalim. But in the
      end, and perhaps even from the very beginning, the suffrages of the people
      were mainly with the sacred stone of the ark. He was the God of Israel,
      and they were the chosen people of Jahweh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The custom of circumcision must have proved at once the symbol and in part
      the cause, in part the effect, of this general devotion of the people to a
      single supreme god. At first, no doubt, only the first-born or other
      persons specially dedicated to Jahweh, would undergo the rite which marked
      them out so clearly as the devotees of the god of fertility. But as time
      went on, long before the triumph of the exclusive Jahweh-worship, it would
      seem that the practice of offering up every male child to the national god
      had become universal. As early as the shadowy reign of David, the
      Philistines are reproachfully alluded to in our legends as &ldquo;the
      uncircumcised&rdquo;; whence we may perhaps conclude (though the authority
      is doubtful) that even then circumcision had become coextensive with
      Israelitish citizenship. Such universal dedication of the whole males of
      the race to the national god must have done much to ensure his ultimate
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we look at the circumstances of the Israelites in Palestine, we shall
      easily see how both religious unity and intense national patriotism were
      fostered by the very nature of their tenure of the soil; and also why a
      deity mainly envisaged as a god of generation should have become the most
      important member of their national pantheon. Their position during the
      first few centuries of their <span class="pagenum">216</span><a
      name="link216" id="link216"></a>life in Lower Syria may be compared to
      that of the Dorians in Peloponnesus: they were but a little garrison in a
      hostile land fighting incessantly with half-conqùered tributaries and
      encircling foes; now hard-pressed by rebellions of their internal enemies;
      and now again rendered subject themselves to the hostile Philistines on
      their maritime border. The handful of rude warriors who burst upon the
      land under such bloodthirsty leaders as the mystical Joshua could only
      hope for success by rapid and constant increase of their numbers, and by
      avoiding as far as possible those internal quarrels which were always the
      prelude to national disgrace. To be &ldquo;a mother in Israel&rdquo; is
      the highest hope of every Hebrew woman. Hence it was natural that a god of
      generation should become the chief among the local deities, and that the
      promise held out by his priests of indefinite multiplication should make
      him the most popular and powerful member of the Israelitish pantheon. And
      though all the stone gods were probably phallic, yet Jahweh, as the
      ethnical patron, seems most of all to have been regarded as the giver of
      increase to Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems clear, too, that the common worship of Jahweh was at first the
      only solid bond of union between the scattered and discordant tribes who
      were afterwards to grow into the Israelitish people. This solidarity of
      god and tribe has well been insisted on by Professor Robertson Smith as a
      common feature of all Semitic worship. The ark of Jahweh in its house at
      Shiloh appears to have formed the general meeting-place for Hebrew
      patriotism, as the sanctuary of Olympia formed a focus later for the
      dawning sense of Hellenic unity. The ark was taken out to carry before the
      Hebrew army, that the god of Israel might fight for his worshippers.
      Evidently, therefore, from a very early date, Jahweh was regarded in a
      literal sense as the god of battles, the power upon whom Israel might
      specially rely to guard it against its enemies. When, as the legends tell
      us, the national unity was realised under <span class="pagenum">217</span><a
      name="link217" id="link217"></a>David; when the subject peoples were
      finally merged into a homogeneous whole; when the last relics of
      Canaanitish nationality were stamped out by the final conquest of the
      Jebusites; and when Jerusalem was made the capital of a united Israel,
      this feeling must have increased both in extent and intensity. The
      bringing of Jahweh to Jerusalem by David, and the building of his temple
      by Solomon (if these facts be historical), must have helped to stamp him
      as the great god of the race: and though Solomon also erected temples to
      other Hebrew gods, which remained in existence for some centuries, we may
      be sure that from the date of the opening of the great central shrine,
      Jahweh remained the principal deity of the southern kingdom at least,
      after the separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one characteristic of Jahweh-worship, however, which especially
      helped to make it at last an <i>exclusive</i> cult, and thus paved the way
      for its final development into a pure monotheism. Jahweh was specially
      known to be a &ldquo;jealous god&rdquo;: this is a trait in his
      temperament early and often insisted on. We do not know when or where the
      famous &ldquo;Ten Words&rdquo; were first promulgated; but we have every
      reason to believe that in essence at least they date from a very antique
      period. Now, at the head of these immemorial precepts of Jahweh stands the
      prohibition of placing any other gods before his face. Originally, no
      doubt, the prohibition meant exactly what it states; that Jahweh would
      endure no companion gods to share his temple; that wherever he dwelt, he
      would dwell alone without what the Greeks would have called fellow
      shrine-sharers. Thus we know that no ashera was to be driven into the
      ground near Jahweh&rsquo;s ark; and that when Dagon found himself face to
      face with the Rock of Israel, he broke in pieces, and could not stand
      before the awful presence of the great Hebrew Pillar. No more than this,
      then, was at first demanded by &ldquo;the jealous god&rdquo;: he asked of
      his worshippers that they should keep him apart from the society of all
      inferior gods, <span class="pagenum">218</span><a name="link218"
      id="link218"></a>should allow no minor or rival deity to enter his
      precincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, however, as Jahweh-worship grew deeper, and the conception of
      godhead became wider and more sublime, the Jahweh-worshipper began to put
      a stricter interpretation upon the antique command of the jealous god. It
      was supposed that every circumcised person, every man visibly devoted to
      Jahweh, owed to Jahweh alone his whole religious service. Nobody doubted
      as yet, indeed, that other gods existed: but the extreme Jehovists in the
      later days of national independence held as an article of faith that no
      true Israelite ought in any way to honour them. An internal religious
      conflict thus arose between the worshippers of Jahweh and the worshippers
      of the Baalim, in which, as might be expected, the devotees of the
      national god had very much the best of it. Exclusive Jahweh-worship became
      thenceforth the ideal of the extreme Jehovists: they began to regard all
      other gods as &ldquo;idols,&rdquo; to be identified with their images;
      they began to look upon Jahweh alone as a living god, at least within the
      bounds of the Israelitish nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this result, another ancient prohibition of the priests of Jahweh no
      doubt largely contributed. The priesthood held it unlawful to make or
      multiply images of Jahweh. The one sacred stone enclosed in the ark was
      alone to be worshipped: and by thus concentrating on Shiloh, or afterwards
      on Jerusalem, the whole religious spirit of the ethnical cult, they must
      largely have succeeded in cementing the national unity. Strict Jehovists
      looked with dislike upon the adoration paid to the bull-images in the
      northern kingdom, though those, too, were regarded (at least in later
      days) as representatives of Jahweh. They held that the true god of Abraham
      was to be found only in the ark at Jerusalem, and that to give to the Rock
      of Israel human form or bestial figure was in itself a high crime against
      the majesty of their deity. Hence arose the peculiar Hebrew dislike to
      &ldquo;idolatry&rdquo;; a dislike never <span class="pagenum">219</span><a
      name="link219" id="link219"></a>equally shared by any but Semitic peoples,
      and having deep roots, apparently, at once in the inartistic genius of the
      people and in the profound metaphysical and dreamy character of Semitic
      thinking. The comparative emptiness of Semitic shrines, indeed, was always
      a stumbling-block to the Greek, with his numerous and exquisite images of
      anthropomorphic deities.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that was now wanted to drive the increasingly exclusive and immaterial
      Jahweh-worship into pure monotheism for the whole people was the spur of a
      great national enthusiasm, in answer to some dangerous external attack
      upon the existence of Israel and of Israel&rsquo;s god. This final touch
      was given by the aggression of Assyria, and later of Babylon. For years
      the two tiny Israelitish kingdoms had maintained a precarious independence
      between the mighty empires of Egypt and Mesopotamia. In the eighth
      century, it became certain that they could no longer play their accustomed
      game of clever diplomacy and polite subjection. The very existence of
      Israel was at stake; and the fanatical worshippers of Jahweh, now pushed
      to an extreme of frenzy by the desperate straits to which they were
      reduced, broke out in that memorable ecstasy of enthusiasm which we may
      fairly call the Age of the Prophets, and which produced the earliest
      masterpieces of Hebrew literature in the wild effort to oppose to the arms
      of the invaders the passive resistance of a supreme Jahweh. In times of
      old, the prophets say, when Jahweh led the forces of Israel, the horses
      and the chariots of their enemies counted for naught: if in this crisis
      Israel would cease to think of aid from Egypt or alliance with Assyria&mdash;if
      Israel would get rid of all her other gods and trust only to Jahweh,&mdash;then
      Jahweh would break asunder the strength of Assyria and would reduce
      Babylon to nothing before his chosen people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the language that Isaiah ventured to use in the very crisis of a
      grave national danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, strange as it seems to us that any people should have <span
      class="pagenum">220</span><a name="link220" id="link220"></a>thrown
      themselves into such a general state of fanatical folly, it is
      nevertheless true that these extraordinary counsels prevailed in both the
      Israelitish kingdoms, and that the very moment when the national existence
      was most seriously imperilled was the moment chosen by the Jehovistic
      party for vigorously attempting a religious reformation. The downfall of
      Ephraim only quickened the bigoted belief of the fanatics in Judah that
      pure Jahweh-worship was the one possible panacea for the difficulties of
      Israel. Taking advantage of a minority and of a plastic young king, they
      succeeded in imposing exclusive Jehovism upon the half-unwilling people.
      The timely forgery of the Book of Deuteromony&mdash;the first germ of the
      Pentateuch&mdash;by the priests of the temple at Jerusalem was quickly
      followed by the momentary triumph of pure Jahweh-worship. In this
      memorable document, the exclusive cult of Jahweh was falsely said to have
      descended from the earliest periods of the national existence. Josiah, we
      are told, alarmed at the denunciations in the forged roll of the law, set
      himself to work at once to root out by violent means every form of &ldquo;idolatry.&rdquo;
      He brought forth from the house of Jahweh &ldquo;the vessels that were
      made for the Baal, and for the Ashera, and for all the Host of Heaven, and
      he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron.&rdquo; He
      abolished all the shrines and priesthoods of other gods in the cities of
      Judah, and put down &ldquo;them that burned incense to the Baal, to the
      sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and all the Host of Heaven.&rdquo;
      He also brought out the Ashera from the temple of Jahweh, and burnt it to
      ashes; and &ldquo;took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given
      to the sun, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.&rdquo; And by
      destroying the temples said to have been built by Solomon for Chemosh,
      Milcom, and Ashtoreth, he left exclusive and triumphant Jahweh-worship the
      sole accredited religion of Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      All, however, was of no avail. Religious fanaticism could <span
      class="pagenum">221</span><a name="link221" id="link221"></a>not save the
      little principality from the aggressive arms of its powerful neighbours.
      Within twenty or thirty years of Josiah&rsquo;s reformation, the
      Babylonians ceased to toy with their petty tributaries, and thrice
      captured and sacked Jerusalem. The temple of Jahweh was burnt, the chief
      ornaments were removed, and the desolate site itself lay empty and
      deserted. The principal inhabitants were transported to Babylonia, and the
      kingdom of Judah ceased for a time to have any independent existence of
      any sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what, in this disaster, became of Jahweh himself? How fared or fell
      the Sacred Stone in the ark, the Rock of Israel, in this general
      destruction of all his holiest belongings? Strange to say, the Hebrew
      annalist never stops to tell us. In the plaintive catalogue of the wrongs
      wrought by the Babylonians at Jerusalem, every pot and shovel and vessel
      is enumerated, but &ldquo;the ark of God&rdquo; is not so much as once
      mentioned. Perhaps the historian shrank from relating that final disgrace
      of his country&rsquo;s deity; perhaps a sense of reverence prevented him
      from chronicling it; perhaps he knew nothing of what had finally been done
      with the cherished and time-honoured stone pillar of his ancestors. It is
      possible, too, that with his later and more etherealised conceptions of
      the cult of his god, he had ceased to regard the ark itself as the abode
      of Jahweh, and was unaware that his tribal deity had been represented in
      the innermost shrine of the temple by a rough-hewn pillar. Be that as it
      may, the actual fate of Jahweh himself is involved for us now in
      impenetrable obscurity. Probably the invaders who took away &ldquo;the
      treasures of the house of Jahweh, and cut in pieces all the vessels of
      gold which Solomon, King of Israel, had made,&rdquo; would care but little
      for the rude sacred stone of a conquered people. We may conjecture that
      they broke Jahweh into a thousand fragments and ground him to powder, as
      Josiah had done with the Baalim and the Ashera, so that his very relics
      could no longer be recognised or worshipped by <span class="pagenum">222</span><a
      name="link222" id="link222"></a>his followers. At any rate, we hear no
      more, from that time forth, of Jahweh himself, as a material existence, or
      of the ark he dwelt in. His spirit alone survived unseen, to guard and
      protect his chosen people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, strange to say, this final disappearance of Jahweh himself, as a
      visible and tangible god, from the page of history, instead of proving the
      signal for the utter downfall of his cult and his sanctity, was the very
      making of Jahweh-worship as a spiritual, a monotheistic, and a
      cosmopolitan religion. At the exact moment when Jahweh ceased to exist,
      the religion of Jahweh began to reach its highest and fullest development.
      Even before the captivity, as we have seen, the prophets and their party
      had begun to form a most exalted and spiritualised conception of Jahweh&rsquo;s
      greatness, Jahweh&rsquo;s holiness, Jahweh&rsquo;s unapproachable nature,
      Jahweh&rsquo;s superhuman sublimity and omnipotence. But now that the
      material Jahweh itself, which clogged and cramped their ideas, had
      disappeared for ever, this spiritual conception of a great Unseen God
      widened and deepened amazingly. Forbidden by their creed and by Jahweh&rsquo;s
      own express command to make any image of their chosen deity, the Hebrews
      in Babylonia gradually evolved for themselves the notion of a Supreme
      Ruler wholly freed from material bonds, to be worshipped without image,
      representative, or symbol; a dweller in the heavens, invisible to men, too
      high and pure for human eyes to look upon. The conical stone in the ark
      gave place almost at once to an incorporeal, inscrutable, and almighty
      Being.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the captivity, too, that pure monotheism became for the
      first time the faith of Israel. Convinced that desertion of Jahweh was the
      cause of all their previous misfortunes, the Jews during their exile grew
      more deeply attached than ever to the deity who represented their national
      unity and their national existence. They made their way back in time to
      Judæa, after two generations had passed away, with a firm conviction that
      all their happiness <span class="pagenum">223</span><a name="link223"
      id="link223"></a>depended on restoring in ideal purity a cult that had
      never been the cult of their fathers. A new form of Jahweh-worship had
      become a passion among those who sat disconsolate by the waters of
      Babylon. Few if any of the zealots who returned at last to Jerusalem had
      ever themselves known the stone god who lay shrouded in the ark: it was
      the etherealised Jahweh who ruled in heaven above among the starry hosts
      to whom they offered up aspirations in a strange land for the restoration
      of Israel. In the temple that they built on the sacred site to the new
      figment of their imaginations, Jahweh was no longer personally present: it
      was not so much his &ldquo;house,&rdquo; like the old one demolished by
      the Babylonian invaders, as the place where sacrifice was offered and
      worship paid to the great god in heaven. The new religion was purely
      spiritual; Jahweh had triumphed, but only by losing his distinctive
      personal characteristics, and coming out of the crisis, as it were, the
      blank form or generic conception of pure deity in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is this that gives monotheism its peculiar power, and enables it so
      readily to make its way everywhere. For monotheism is religion reduced to
      its single central element; it contains nothing save what every votary of
      all gods already implicitly believes, with every unnecessary complexity or
      individuality smoothed away and simplified. Its simplicity recommends it
      to all intelligent minds; its uniformity renders it the easiest and most
      economical form of pantheon that man can frame for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the influence of these new ideas, before long, the whole annals of
      Israel were edited and written down in Jehovistic form; the Pentateuch and
      the older historical books assumed the dress in which we now know them.
      From the moment of the return from the captivity, too, the monotheistic
      conception kept ever widening. At first, no doubt, even with the Jews of
      the Sixth Century, Jahweh was commonly looked upon merely as the ethnical
      god of Israel. But, in time, the sublimer and broader conception <span
      class="pagenum">224</span><a name="link224" id="link224"></a>of some few
      among the earlier poetical prophets began to gain general acceptance, and
      Jahweh was regarded as in very deed the one true God of all the world&mdash;somewhat
      such a God as Islam and Christendom to-day acknowledge. Still, even so, he
      was as yet most closely connected with the Jewish people, through whom
      alone the gentiles were expected in the fulness of time to learn his
      greatness. It was reserved for a Græco-Jewish Cilician, five centuries
      later, to fulfil the final ideal of pure cosmopolitan monotheism, and to
      proclaim abroad the unity of god to all nations, with the Catholic Church
      as its earthly witness before the eyes of universal humanity. To Paul of
      Tarsus we owe above all men that great and on the whole cosmopolitanising
      conception.

      class="pagenum">225</span><a name="link225" id="link225"></a>have now in a
      certain sense accomplished our intention of tracing the evolution of gods
      and of God. We have shown how polytheism came to be, and how from it a
      certain particular group of men, the early Israelites, rose by slow
      degrees, through natural stages, to the monotheistic conception. It might
      seem, therefore, as though the task we set before ourselves was now quite
      completed. Nevertheless, many abstruse and difficult questions still lie
      before us. Our problem as yet is hardly half solved. We have still to ask,
      I think, How did this purely local and national Hebrew deity advance to
      the conquest of the civilised world? How from an obscure corner of Lower
      Syria did the god of a small tribe of despised and barbaric tributaries
      slowly live down the great conquering deities of Babylon and Susa, of
      Hellas and Italy? And again, we have further to enquire, Why do most of
      the modern nations which have nominally adopted monotheism yet conceive of
      their god as compounded in some mystically incomprehensible fashion of
      Three Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost? In short, I am not
      satisfied with tracing the idea of a god from the primitive mummy or the
      secondary ghost to the one supreme God of the ancient Hebrews; I desire
      also to follow on that developed concept till it merges at last in the
      triune God of modern Christendom. For, naturally, it is the god in whom
      men believe here and now that most of all concerns and interests us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <span class="pagenum">226</span><a name="link226" id="link226"></a>may
      also add that, incidentally to this supplementary enquiry, we shall come
      upon several additional traits in the idea of deity and several important
      sources of earlier godhead, the consideration of which we had to postpone
      before till a more convenient season. We shall find that the process of
      tracking down Christianity to its hidden springs suggests to us many
      aspects of primitive religion which we were compelled to neglect in our
      first hasty synthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader must remember that in dealing with so complex a subject as that
      of human beliefs and human cults, it is impossible ever to condense the
      whole of the facts at once into a single conspectus. We cannot grasp at a
      time the entire mass of evidence. While we are following out one clue, we
      must neglect another. It is only by examining each main set of components
      in analytical distinctness that we can proceed by degrees to a full and
      complete synthetic reconstruction of the whole vast fabric. We must
      therefore correct and supplement in the sequel much that may have seemed
      vague, inaccurate, or insufficient in our preliminary survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christian religion with which we have next to deal bases itself
      fundamentally upon the personality of a man, by name Jesus, commonly
      described as the Christ, that is to say &ldquo;the anointed.&rdquo; Of
      this most sacred and deified person it is affirmed by modern Christianity,
      and has been affirmed by orthodox Christians from a very early period,
      that he was not originally a mere man, afterwards taken into the godhead,
      but that he was born from the first the son of God, that is to say, of the
      Hebrew Jahweh; that he existed previously from all time; that he was
      miraculously conceived of a virgin mother; that he was crucified and
      buried; that on the third day he arose from the dead; and that he is now a
      living and distinct person in a divine and mystically-united Trinity. I
      propose to show in the subsequent chapters how far all these conceptions
      were already familiar throughout the world in which Christianity <span
      class="pagenum">227</span><a name="link227" id="link227"></a>was
      promulgated, and to how large an extent the new religion owed its rapid
      success to the fact that it was but a <i>résumé</i> or idealised
      embodiment of all the chief conceptions already common to the main cults
      of Mediterranean civilisation. At the moment when the empire was
      cosmopolitanising the world, Christianity began to cosmopolitanise
      religion, by taking into itself whatever was central, common, and
      universal in the worship of the peoples among whom it originated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will begin with the question of the incarnation, which lies at the very
      root of the Christian concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said already that in ancient Egypt and elsewhere, &ldquo;The God
      was the Dead King, the King was the Living God.&rdquo; This is true,
      literally and absolutely. Since the early kings are gods, the present
      kings, their descendants, are naturally also gods by descent; their blood
      is divine; they differ in nature as well as in position from mere common
      mortals. While they live, they are gods on earth; when they die, they pass
      over to the community of the gods their ancestors, and share with them a
      happy and regal immortality. We have seen how this essential divinity of
      the Pharaoh is a prime article in the religious faith of the Egyptian
      Pyramid-builders. And though in later days, when a Greek dynasty, not of
      the old divine native blood, bore sway in Egypt, this belief in the
      divinity of the king grew fainter, yet to the very last the Ptolemies and
      the Cleopatras bear the title of god or goddess, and carry in their hands
      the sacred <i>tau</i> or <i>crux ansata</i>, the symbol and mark of
      essential divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inference made in Egypt that the children of gods must be themselves
      divine was also made in most other countries, especially in those where
      similar great despotisms established themselves at an early grade of
      culture. Thus in Peru, the Incas were gods. They were the children of the
      Sun; and when they died, it was said that their father, the Sun, had sent
      to fetch them. The Mexican kings were likewise gods, with full control of
      the course of nature; <span class="pagenum">228</span><a name="link228"
      id="link228"></a>they swore at their accession to make the sun shine, the
      rain fall, the rivers flow, and the earth bring forth her fruit in due
      season. How they could promise all this seems at first a little difficult
      for us to conceive; but it will become more comprehensible at a later
      stage of our investigation, when we come to consider the gods of
      cultivation: even at present, if we remember that kings are children of
      the Sun, and that sacred trees, sacred groves, and sacred wells are
      closely connected with the tombs of their ancestors, we can guess at the
      beginning of such a mental connexion. Thus the Chinese emperor is the Son
      of Heaven; he is held responsible to his people for the occurrence of
      drought or other serious derangements of nature. The Parthian kings of the
      Arsacid house, says Mr. Frazer, to whom I am greatly indebted for most of
      the succeeding facts, styled themselves brothers of the sun and moon, and
      were worshipped as deities. Numberless other cases are cited by Mr.
      Frazer, who was the first to point out the full importance of this
      widespread belief in man-gods. I shall follow him largely in the
      subsequent discussion of this cardinal subject, though I shall often give
      to the facts an interpretation slightly different from that which he would
      allow to be the correct one. For to me, godhead springs always from the
      primitive Dead Man, while to Mr. Frazer it is spiritual or animistic in
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these human gods who are gods by descent from deified ancestors,
      there is another class of gods who are gods by inspiration or indwelling
      of the divine spirit, that is to say of some ghost or god who temporarily
      or permanently inhabits the body of a living man. The germ-idea of such
      divine possession we may see in the facts of epilepsy, catalepsy, dream,
      and madness. In all such cases of abnormal nervous condition it seems to
      primitive man, as it still seemed to the Jews of the age of the Gospels,
      that the sufferer is entered or seized upon by some spirit, who bodily
      inhabits him. The spirit may throw <span class="pagenum">229</span><a
      name="link229" id="link229"></a>the man down, or may speak through his
      mouth in strange unknown tongues; it may exalt him so that he can perform
      strange feats of marvellous strength, or may debase him to a position of
      grovelling abjectness. By fasting and religious asceticism men and women
      can even artificially attain this state, when the god speaks through them,
      as he spoke through the mouth of the Pythia at Delphi. And fasting is
      always one of the religious exercises of god-possessed men, priests,
      monks, anchorites, and ascetics in general. Where races have learnt how to
      manufacture intoxicating drinks, or to express narcotic juices from
      plants, they also universally attribute the effects of such plants to the
      personal action of an inspiring spirit&mdash;an idea so persistent even
      into civilised ages that we habitually speak of alcoholic liquors as
      spirits. Both these ways of attaining the presence of an indwelling god
      are commonly practised among savages and half-civilised people.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we recollect how we saw already that ancestral spirits may descend
      from time to time into the skulls that once were theirs, or into the clay
      or wooden images that represent them, and there give oracles, we shall not
      be surprised to find that they can thus enter at times into a human body,
      and speak through its lips, for good or for evil. Indeed, I have dwelt but
      little in this book on this migratory power and this ubiquitousness of the
      spirits, because I have desired to fix attention chiefly on that primary
      aspect of religion which is immediately and directly concerned with
      Worship; but readers familiar with such works as Dr. Tylor&rsquo;s and Mr.
      Frazer&rsquo;s will be well aware of the common power which spirits
      possess of projecting themselves readily into every part of nature. The
      faculty of possession or of divination is but one particular example of
      this well-known attribute. The mysteries and oracles of all creeds are
      full of such phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain persons, again, are born from the womb as incarnations of a god or
      an ancestral spirit. &ldquo;Incarnate gods,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">230</span><a
      name="link230" id="link230"></a>says Mr. Frazer, &ldquo;are common in rude
      society. The incarnation may be temporary or permanent.... When the divine
      spirit has taken up its abode in a human body, the god-man is usually
      expected to vindicate his character by working miracles.&rdquo; Mr. Frazer
      gives several excellent examples of both these classes. I extract a few
      almost verbatim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain persons are possessed from time to time by a spirit or deity;
      while possession lasts, their own personality lies in abeyance, and the
      presence of the spirit is revealed by convulsive shakings and quiverings
      of the body. In this abnormal state, the man&rsquo;s utterances are
      accepted as the voice of the god or spirit dwelling in him and speaking
      through him. In Mangaia, for instance, the priests in whom the gods took
      up their abode were called god-boxes or gods. Before giving oracles, they
      drank an intoxicating liquor, and the words they spoke in their frenzy
      were then regarded as divine. In other cases, the inspired person produces
      the desired condition of intoxication by drinking the fresh blood of a
      victim, human or animal, which, as we shall see hereafter, is probably
      itself an avatar of the inspiring god. In the temple of Apollo Diradiotes
      at Argos, a lamb was sacrificed by night once a month; a woman, who had to
      observe the rule of chastity, tasted its blood, and then gave oracles. At
      Ægira in Achæa the priestess of the Earth drank the fresh blood of a bull
      before she descended into her cave to prophesy. (Note in passing that
      caves, the places of antique burial, are also the usual places for
      prophetic inspiration.) In southern India, the so-called devil-dancer
      drinks the blood of a goat, and then becomes seized with the divine
      afflatus. He is worshipped as a deity, and bystanders ask him questions
      requiring superhuman knowledge to answer. Mr. Frazer extends this list of
      oracular practices by many other striking instances, for which I would
      refer the reader to the original volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of permanent living human gods, inspired by the constant <span
      class="pagenum">231</span><a name="link231" id="link231"></a>indwelling of
      a deity, Mr. Frazer also gives several apt examples. In the Marquesas
      Islands there was a class of men who were deified in their lifetime. They
      were supposed to wield supernatural control over the elements. They could
      give or withhold rain and good harvests. Human sacrifices were offered
      them to appease their wrath. &ldquo;A missionary has described one of
      these human gods from personal observation. The god was a very old man who
      lived in a large house within an enclosure.&rdquo; (A temple in its <i>temenos</i>.)
      &ldquo;In the house was a kind of altar, and on the beams of the house and
      on the trees around it were hung human skeletons, head down. No one
      entered the enclosure, except the persons dedicated to the service of the
      god; only on days when human victims were sacrificed might ordinary people
      penetrate into the precinct. This human god received more sacrifices than
      all the other gods; often he would sit on a sort of scaffold in front of
      his house and call for two or three human victims at a time. They were
      always brought, for the terror he inspired was extreme. He was invoked all
      over the island, and offerings were sent to him from every side.&rdquo;
      Indeed, throughout the South Sea Islands, each island had usually a man
      who embodied its deity. Such men were called gods, and were regarded as of
      divine substance. The man-god was sometimes a king; oftener he was a
      priest or a subordinate chief. The gods of Samoa were sometimes
      permanently incarnate in men, who gave oracles, received offerings
      (occasionally of human flesh), healed the sick, answered prayer, and
      generally performed all divine functions. Of the Fijians it is said:
      &ldquo;There appears to be no certain line of demarcation between departed
      spirits and gods, nor between gods and living men, for many of the priests
      and old chiefs are considered as sacred persons, and not a few of them
      will also claim to themselves the right of divinity. &lsquo;I am a god,&rsquo;
      Tuikilakila would say; and he believed it too.&rdquo; There is said to be
      a sect in Orissa who worship the Queen of England as their chief divinity;
      <span class="pagenum">232</span><a name="link232" id="link232"></a>and
      another sect in the Punjab worshipped during his lifetime the great
      General Nicholson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, I believe, kings are divine by birth, as descendants of gods;
      but sometimes divinity is conferred upon them with the kingship, as indeed
      was the case even in the typical instance of Egypt. Tanatoa, king of
      Raiatea, was deified by a certain ceremony performed at the chief temple.
      He was made a god before the gods his ancestors, as Celtic chiefs received
      the chieftainship standing on the sacred stone of their fathers. As one of
      the deities of his subjects, therefore, the king was worshipped, consulted
      as an oracle, and honoured with sacrifices. The king of Tahiti at his
      inauguration received a sacred girdle of red and yellow feathers, which
      not only raised him to the highest earthly station, but also identified
      him with the heavenly gods. Compare the way in which the gods of Egypt
      make the king one of themselves, as represented in the bas-reliefs, by the
      presentation of the divine <i>tau</i>. In the Pelew Islands, a god may
      incarnate himself in a common person; this lucky man is thereupon raised
      to sovereign rank, and rules as god and king over the community. Not
      unsimilar is the mode of selection of a Grand Lama. In later stages, the
      king ceases to be quite a god, but retains the anointment, the
      consecration on a holy stone, and the claim to &ldquo;divine right&rdquo;;
      he also shows some last traces of deity in his divine power to heal
      diseases, which fades away at last into the practice of &ldquo;touching
      for king&rsquo;s evil.&rdquo; On all these questions, again, Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s
      great work is a perfect thesaurus of apposite instances. I abstain from
      quoting his whole two volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But did ideas of this character still survive in the Mediterranean world
      of the first and second centuries, where Christianity was evolved? Most
      undoubtedly they did. In Egypt, the divine line of the Ptolemies had only
      just become extinct. In Rome itself, the divine Cæsar had recently
      undergone official apotheosis; the divine Augustus had ruled over the
      empire as the adopted son of the new-made <span class="pagenum">233</span><a
      name="link233" id="link233"></a>god; and altars rose in provincial cities
      to the divine spirit of the reigning Trajan or Hadrian. Indeed, both forms
      of divinity were claimed indirectly for the god Julius; he was divine by
      apotheosis, but he was also descended from the goddess Venus. So the
      double claim was made for the central personage of the Christian faith: he
      was the son of God&mdash;that is to say of Jahweh; but he was also of
      kingly Jewish origin, a descendant of David, and in the genealogies
      fabricated for him in the Gospels extreme importance is attached to this
      pretended royal ancestry. Furthermore, how readily men of the
      Mediterranean civilisation could then identify living persons with gods we
      see in the familiar episode of Paul and Barnabas at Lystra. Incarnation,
      in short, was a perfectly ordinary feature of religion and daily life as
      then understood. And to oriental ideas in particular, the conception was
      certainly no novelty. &ldquo;Even an infant king,&rdquo; say the laws of
      Manu, which go to the root of so much eastern thinking, &ldquo;must not be
      despised from an idea that he is a mere mortal: for he is a great deity in
      human form.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To most modern thinkers, however, it would seem at first sight like a
      grave difficulty in the way of accepting the deity of an ordinary man that
      he should have suffered a violent death at the hands of his enemies. Yet
      this fact, instead of standing in the way of acceptance of Christ&rsquo;s
      divinity, is really almost a guarantee and proof of it. For, strange as it
      sounds to us, the human gods were frequently or almost habitually put to
      death by their votaries. The secret of this curious ritual and persistent
      custom has been ingeniously deciphered for us by Mr. Frazer, whose book is
      almost entirely devoted to these two main questions, &ldquo;<i>Why do men
      kill their gods?</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Why do they eat and drink their
      flesh and blood under the form of bread and wine?</i>&rdquo; We must go
      over some of the same ground here in rapid summary, with additional
      corollaries; and we must also bring Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s curious facts into
      line with our general principles of the origin of godhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, <span class="pagenum">234</span><a name="link234" id="link234"></a>it
      may be well to add here two similar instances of almost contemporary
      apotheoses. The dictator Julius was killed by a band of reactionary
      conspirators, and yet was immediately raised to divine honours. A little
      later, Antinous, the favourite of the emperor Hadrian, devoted himself to
      death in order to avert misfortune from his master; he was at once
      honoured with temples and worship. The belief that it is expedient that
      &ldquo;one man should die for the people,&rdquo; and that the person who
      so dies is a god in human shape, formed, as we shall see, a common
      component of many faiths, and especially of the faiths of the eastern
      Mediterranean. Indeed, a little later, each Christian martyrdom is
      followed as a matter of course by canonisation&mdash;that is to say, by
      minor apotheosis. Mr. Frazer has traced the genesis of this group of
      allied beliefs in the slaughter of the man-god in the most masterly
      manner. They spring from a large number of converging ideas, some of which
      can only come out in full as we proceed in later chapters to other
      branches of our subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all parts of the world, one of the commonest prerogatives and functions
      of the human god is the care of the weather. As representative of heaven,
      it is his business to see that rain falls in proper quantities, and that
      the earth brings forth her increase in due season. But, god though he is,
      he must needs be coerced if he does not attend to this business properly.
      Thus, in West Africa, when prayers and offerings presented to the king
      have failed to procure rain, his subjects bind him with ropes, and take
      him to the grave of his deified forefathers, that he may obtain from them
      the needful change in the weather. Here we see in the fullest form the
      nature of the relation between dead gods and living ones. The Son is the
      natural mediator between men and the Father. Among the Antaymours of
      Madagascar, the king is responsible for bad crops and all other
      misfortunes. The ancient Scythians, when food was scarce, put their kings
      in bonds. <span class="pagenum">235</span><a name="link235" id="link235"></a>The
      Banjars in West Africa ascribe to their king the power of causing rain or
      fine weather. As long as the climate is satisfactory, they load him with
      presents of grain and cattle. But if long drought or rain does serious
      harm, they insult and beat him till the weather changes. The Burgundians
      deposed their king if he failed to make their crops grow to their
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further than that, certain tribes have even killed their kings in times of
      scarcity. In the days of the Swedish king Domalde, a mighty famine broke
      out, which lasted several years, and could not be stayed by human or
      animal sacrifices. So, in a great popular assembly held at Upsala, the
      chiefs decided that King Domalde himself was the cause of the scarcity,
      and must be sacrificed for good seasons. Then they slew him, and smeared
      with his blood the altars of the gods. Here we must recollect that the
      divine king is himself a god, the descendant of gods, and he is sacrificed
      to the offended spirits of his own forefathers. We shall see hereafter how
      often similar episodes occur&mdash;how the god is sacrificed, himself to
      himself; how the Son is sacrificed to the Father, both being gods; and how
      the Father sacrifices his Son, to make a god of him. To take another
      Scandinavian example from Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s collection: in the reign of
      King Olaf, there came a great dearth, and the people thought that the
      fault was the king&rsquo;s, because he was sparing in sacrifices. So they
      mustered an army and marched against him; then they surrounded his palace
      and burnt it, with him within it, &ldquo;giving him to Odin as a sacrifice
      for good crops.&rdquo; Many points must here be noted. Olaf himself was of
      divine stock, a descendant of Odin. He is burnt as an offering to his
      father, much as the Carthaginians burnt their sons, or the king of Moab
      his first-born, as sacrifices to Melcarth and to Chemosh. The royal and
      divine person is here offered up to his own fathers, just as on the cross
      of the founder of Christendom the inscription ran, &ldquo;Jesus of
      Nazareth, king of the Jews,&rdquo; and just as in Christian <span
      class="pagenum">236</span><a name="link236" id="link236"></a>theology God
      offers his Son as a sacrifice to his own offended justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other instances elsewhere point to the same analogies. In 1814, a
      pestilence broke out among the reindeer of the Chukches (a Siberian
      tribe); and the shamans declared that the beloved chief Koch must be
      sacrificed to the angry gods (probably his ancestors); so the chief&rsquo;s
      own son stabbed him with a dagger. On the coral island of Niue in the
      South Pacific there once reigned a line of kings; but they were also
      &ldquo;high-priests&rdquo; (that is to say, divine representatives of
      divine ancestors); and they were supposed to make the crops grow, for a
      reason which will come out more fully in the sequel. In times of scarcity,
      the people &ldquo;grew angry with them and killed them,&rdquo; or more
      probably, as I would interpret the facts, sacrificed them for crops to
      their own deified ancestors. So in time there were no kings left, and the
      monarchy ceased altogether on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The divine kings being thus responsible for rain and wind, and for the
      growth of crops, whose close dependence upon them we shall further
      understand hereafter, it is clear that they are persons of the greatest
      importance and value to the community. Moreover, in the ideas of early
      men, their spirit is almost one with that of external nature, over which
      they exert such extraordinary powers. A subtle sympathy seems to exist
      between the king and the world outside. The sacred trees which embody his
      ancestors; the crops, which, as we shall see hereafter, equally embody
      them; the rain-clouds in which they dwell; the heaven they inhabit;&mdash;all
      these, as it were, are parts of the divine body, and therefore by
      implication part of the god-king&rsquo;s, who is but the avatar of his
      deified fathers. Hence, whatever affects the king, affects the sky, the
      crops, the rain, the people. There is even reason to believe that the
      man-god, representative of the ancestral spirit and tribal god, is
      therefore the representative and embodiment of the tribe itself&mdash;the
      soul of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>L'état, c&rsquo;est moi</i> <span class="pagenum">237</span><a
      name="link237" id="link237"></a>is no mere personal boast of Louis
      Quatorze; it is the belated survival of an old and once very powerful
      belief, shared in old times by kings and peoples. Whatever hurts the king,
      hurts the people, and hurts by implication external nature. Whatever
      preserves the king from danger, preserves and saves the world and the
      nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frazer has shown many strange results of these early beliefs&mdash;which
      he traces, however, to the supposed primitive animism, and not (as I have
      done) to the influence of the ghost-theory. Whichever interpretation we
      accept, however, his facts at least are equally valuable. He calls
      attention to the number of kingly taboos which are all intended to prevent
      the human god from endangering or imperilling his divine life, or from
      doing anything which might react hurtfully upon nature and the welfare of
      his people. The man-god is guarded by the strictest rules, and surrounded
      by precautions of the utmost complexity. He may not set his sacred foot on
      the ground, because he is a son of heaven; he may not eat or drink with
      his sacred mouth certain dangerous, impure, or unholy foods; he may not
      have his sacred hair cut, or his sacred nails pared; he must preserve
      intact his divine body, and every part of it&mdash;the incarnation of the
      community,&mdash;lest evil come of his imprudence or his folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mikado, for example, was and still is regarded as an incarnation of
      the sun, the deity who rules the entire universe, gods and men included.
      The greatest care must therefore be taken both <i>by</i> him and <i>of</i>
      him. His whole life, down to its minutest details, must be so regulated
      that no act of his may upset the established order of nature. Lest he
      should touch the earth, he used to be carried wherever he went on men&rsquo;s
      shoulders. He could not expose his sacred person to the open air, nor eat
      out of any but a perfectly new vessel. In every way his sanctity and his
      health were jealously guarded, and he was treated like a person <span
      class="pagenum">238</span><a name="link238" id="link238"></a>whose
      security was important to the whole course of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frazer quotes several similar examples, of which the most striking is
      that of the high pontiff of the Zapotecs, an ancient people of Southern
      Mexico. This spiritual lord, a true Pope or Lama, governed Yopaa, one of
      the chief cities of the kingdom, with absolute dominion. He was looked
      upon as a god &ldquo;whom earth was not worthy to hold or the sun to shine
      upon.&rdquo; He profaned his sanctity if he touched the common ground with
      his holy foot. The officers who bore his palanquin on their shoulders were
      chosen from the members of the highest families; he hardly deigned to look
      on anything around him; those who met him prostrated themselves humbly on
      the ground, lest death should overtake them if they even saw his divine
      shadow. (Compare the apparition of Jahweh to Moses.) A rule of continence
      was ordinarily imposed upon him; but on certain days in the year which
      were high festivals, it was usual for him to get ceremonially and
      sacramentally drunk. On such days, we may be sure, the high gods
      peculiarly entered into him with the intoxicating pulque, and the
      ancestral spirits reinforced his godhead. While in this exalted state (&ldquo;full
      of the god,&rdquo; as a Greek or Roman would have said) the divine pontiff
      received a visit from one of the most beautiful of the virgins consecrated
      to the service of the gods. If the child she bore him was a son, it
      succeeded in due time to the throne of the Zapotecs. We have here again an
      instructive mixture of the various ideas out of which such divine kingship
      and godship is constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might seem at first sight a paradoxical corollary that people who thus
      safeguard and protect their divine king, the embodiment of nature, should
      also habitually and ceremonially kill him. Yet the apparent paradox is,
      from the point of view of the early worshipper, both natural and
      reasonable. We read of the Congo negroes that they have a supreme pontiff
      whom they regard as a god upon earth, and <span class="pagenum">239</span><a
      name="link239" id="link239"></a>all-powerful in heaven. But, &ldquo;if he
      were to die a natural death, they thought the world would perish, and the
      earth, which he alone sustained by his power and merit, would immediately
      be annihilated.&rdquo; This idea of a god as the creator and supporter of
      all things, without whom nothing would be, is of course a familiar
      component element of the most advanced theology. But many nations which
      worship human gods carry out the notion to its logical conclusion in the
      most rigorous manner. Since the god is a man, it would obviously be quite
      wrong to let him grow old and weak; since thereby the whole course of
      nature might be permanently enfeebled; rain would but dribble; crops would
      grow thin; rivers would trickle away; and the race he ruled would dwindle
      to nothing. Hence senility must never overcome the sacred man-god; he must
      be killed in the fulness of his strength and health (say, about his
      thirtieth year), so that the indwelling spirit, yet young and fresh, may
      migrate unimpaired into the body of some newer and abler representative.
      Mr. Frazer was the first, I believe, to point out this curious result of
      primitive human reasoning, and to illustrate it by numerous and conclusive
      instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot transcribe here in full Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s admirable argument,
      with the examples which enforce it; but I must at least give so much of it
      in brief as will suffice for comprehension of our succeeding exposition.
      &ldquo;No amount of care and precaution,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;will
      prevent the man-god from growing old and feeble, and at last dying. His
      worshippers have to lay their account with this sad necessity and to meet
      it as best they can. The danger is a formidable one; for if the course of
      nature is dependent on the man-god&rsquo;s life, what catastrophes may not
      be expected from the gradual enfeeblement of his powers and their final
      extinction in death? There is only one way of averting these dangers. The
      man-god must be killed as soon as he shows symptoms that his powers are
      beginning to fail, and his soul must be transferred to a <span
      class="pagenum">240</span><a name="link240" id="link240"></a>vigorous
      successor before it has been seriously impaired by the threatened decay.
      The advantages of thus putting the man-god to death instead of allowing
      him to die of old age and disease are, to the savage, obvious enough. For
      if the man-god dies what we call a natural death, it means, according to
      the savage, that his soul has either voluntarily departed from his body
      and refuses to return, or more commonly that it has been extracted or at
      least detained in its wanderings by a demon or sorcerer. In any of these
      cases the soul of the man-god is lost to his worshippers; and with it
      their prosperity is gone and their very existence endangered. Even if they
      could arrange to catch the soul of the dying god as it left his lips or
      his nostrils and so transfer it to a successor, this would not effect
      their purpose; for, thus dying of disease, his soul would necessarily
      leave his body in the last stage of weakness and exhaustion, and as such
      it would continue to drag out a feeble existence in the body to which it
      might be transferred. Whereas by killing him his worshippers could, in the
      first place, make sure of catching his soul as it escaped and transferring
      it to a suitable successor; and, in the second place, by killing him
      before his natural force was abated, they would secure that the world
      should not fall into decay with the decay of the man-god. Every purpose,
      therefore, was answered, and all dangers averted by thus killing the
      man-god and transferring his soul, while yet at its prime, to a vigorous
      successor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, when the pontiff of Congo grew old, and seemed likely to
      die, the man who was destined to succeed him in the pontificate entered
      his house with a rope or club, and strangled or felled him. The Ethiopian
      kings of Meroe were worshipped as gods; but when the priests thought fit,
      they sent a messenger to the king, ordering him to die, and alleging an
      oracle of the gods (or earlier kings) as the reason of their command. This
      command the kings always obeyed down to the reign of Ergamenes, a
      contemporary of Ptolemy II. of Egypt. So, when <span class="pagenum">241</span><a
      name="link241" id="link241"></a>the king of Unyoro in Central Africa falls
      ill, or begins to show signs of approaching age, one of his own wives is
      compelled by custom to kill him. The kings of Sofala were regarded by
      their people as gods who could give rain or sunshine; but the slightest
      bodily blemish, such as the loss of a tooth, was considered a sufficient
      reason for putting one of these powerful man-gods to death; he must be
      whole and sound, lest all nature pay for it. Many kings, human gods,
      divine priests, or sultans are enumerated by Mr. Frazer, each of whom must
      be similarly perfect in every limb and member. The same perfect manhood is
      still exacted of the Christian Pope, who, however, is not put to death in
      case of extreme age or feebleness. But there is reason to believe that the
      Grand Lama, the divine Pope of the Tibetan Buddhists, is killed from time
      to time, so as to keep him &ldquo;ever fresh and ever young,&rdquo; and to
      allow the inherent deity within him to escape full-blooded into another
      embodiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these cases the divine king or priest is suffered by his people to
      retain office, or rather to house the godhead, till by some outward
      defect, or some visible warning of age or illness, he shows them that he
      is no longer equal to the proper performance of his divine functions.
      Until such symptoms appear, he is not put to death. Some peoples, however,
      as Mr. Frazer shows, have not thought it safe to wait for even the
      slightest symptom of decay before killing the human god or king; they have
      destroyed him in the plenitude of his life and vigour. In such cases, the
      people fix a term beyond which the king may not reign, and at the close of
      which he must die, the term being short enough to prevent the probability
      of degeneration meanwhile. In some parts of Southern India, for example,
      the term was fixed at twelve years; at the expiration of that time, the
      king had to cut himself to pieces visibly, before the great local idol, of
      which he was in all probability the human equivalent. &ldquo;Whoever
      desires to reign other twelve years,&rdquo; says an early observer,
      &ldquo;and to undertake <span class="pagenum">242</span><a name="link242"
      id="link242"></a>this martyrdom for the sake of the idol, has to be
      present looking on at this; and from that place they raise him up as king.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The king of Calicut, on the Malabar coast, had also to cut his throat in
      public after a twelve years&rsquo; reign. But towards the end of the
      seventeenth century, the rule was so far relaxed that the king was allowed
      to retain the throne, and probably the godship, if he could protect
      himself against all comers. As long as he was strong enough to guard his
      position, it was held that he was strong enough to retain the divine power
      unharmed. The King of the Wood at Aricia held his priesthood and ghostly
      kingship on the same condition; as long as he could hold his own against
      all comers, he might continue to be priest; but any runaway slave had the
      right of attacking the king; and if he could kill him, he became the King
      of the Wood till some other in turn slew him. This curious instance has
      been amply and learnedly discussed by Mr. Frazer, and forms the central
      subject of his admirable treatise.
    </p>
    <p>
      More often still, however, the divine priesthood, kingship, or godhead was
      held for one year alone, for a reason which we shall more fully comprehend
      after we have considered the annual gods of cultivation. The most
      interesting example, and the most cognate to our present enquiry, is that
      of the Babylonian custom cited by Berosus. During the five days of the
      festival called the Sacæa, a prisoner condemned to death was dressed in
      the king&rsquo;s robes, seated on the king&rsquo;s throne, allowed to eat,
      drink, and order whatever he chose, and even permitted to sleep with the
      king&rsquo;s concubines. But at the end of five days, he was stripped of
      his royal insignia, scourged, and crucified. I need hardly point out the
      crucial importance of this singular instance, occurring in a country
      within the Semitic circle. Mr. Frazer rightly concludes that the condemned
      man was meant to die in the king&rsquo;s stead; was himself, in point of
      fact, a king substitute; and was therefore invested for the time being
      with the fullest <span class="pagenum">243</span><a name="link243"
      id="link243"></a>prerogatives of royalty. Doubtless we have here to deal
      with a modification of an older and sterner rule, which compelled the king
      himself to be slain annually. &ldquo;When the time drew near for the king
      to be put to death,&rdquo; says Mr. Frazer, &ldquo;he abdicated for a few
      days, during which a temporary king reigned and suffered in his stead. At
      first the temporary king may have been an innocent person, possibly a
      member of the king&rsquo;s own family; but with the growth of
      civilisation, the sacrifice of an innocent person would be revolting to
      the public sentiment, and accordingly a condemned criminal would be
      invested with the brief and fatal sovereignty.... We shall find other
      examples of a criminal representing a dying god. For we must not forget
      that the king is slain in his character of a god, his death and
      resurrection, as the only means of perpetuating the divine life
      unimpaired, being deemed necessary for the salvation of his people and the
      world.&rdquo; I need not point out the importance of such ideas as
      assisting in the formation of a groundwork for the doctrines of
      Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other evidence on this point, of a more indirect nature, has been
      collected by Mr. Frazer; and still more will come out in subsequent
      chapters. For the present I will only add that the annual character of
      some such sacrifices seems to be derived from the analogy of the
      annually-slain gods of cultivation, whose origin and meaning we have yet
      to examine. These gods, being intimately connected with each year&rsquo;s
      crop, especially with crops of cereals, pulses, and other annual grains,
      were naturally put to death at the beginning of each agricultural year,
      and as a rule about the period of the spring equinox,&mdash;say, at
      Easter. Starting from that analogy, as I believe, many races thought it
      fit that the other divine person, the man-god king, should also be put to
      death annually, often about the same period. And I will even venture to
      suggest the possibility that the institution of annual consuls, archons,
      etc., may have something to do with such annual sacrifices. <span
      class="pagenum">244</span><a name="link244" id="link244"></a>Certainly the
      legend of Codrus at Athens and of the Regifugium at Rome seem to point to
      an ancient king-slaying custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, it is now certain that the putting to death of a public
      man-god was a common incident of many religions. And it is also clear that
      in many cases travellers and other observers have made serious mistakes by
      not understanding the inner nature of such god-slaying practices. For
      instance it is now pretty certain that Captain Cook was killed by the
      people of Tahiti just <i>because</i> he was a god, perhaps in order to
      keep his spirit among them. It is likewise clear that many rites, commonly
      interpreted as human sacrifices to a god, are really god-slayings; often
      the god in one of his human avatars seems to be offered to himself, in his
      more permanent embodiment as an idol or stone image. This idea of
      sacrificing a god, himself to himself, is one which will frequently meet
      us hereafter; and I need hardly point out that, as &ldquo;<i>the sacrifice
      of the mass</i>,&rdquo; it has even enshrined itself in the central
      sanctuary of the Christian religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christianity apparently took its rise among a group of irregular northern
      Israelites, the Galilæans, separated from the mass of their
      coreligionists, the Jews, by the intervention of a heretical and
      doubtfully Israelitish wedge, the Samaritans. The earliest believers in
      Jesus were thus intermediate between Jews and Syrians. According to their
      own tradition, they were first described by the name of Christians at
      Antioch; and they appear on many grounds to have attracted attention first
      in Syria in general, and particularly at Damascus. We may be sure,
      therefore, that their tenets from the first would contain many elements
      more or less distinctly Syrian, and especially such elements as formed
      ideas held in common by almost all the surrounding peoples. As a matter of
      fact. Christianity, as we shall see hereafter, may be regarded
      historically as a magma of the most fundamental religious ideas of the
      Mediterranean basin, and especially of the eastern <span class="pagenum">245</span><a
      name="link245" id="link245"></a>Mediterranean, grafted on to the Jewish
      cult and the Jewish scriptures, and clustering round the personality of
      the man-god, Jesus. It is interesting therefore to note that in Syria and
      the north Semitic area the principal cult was the cult of just such a
      slain man-god, Adonis,&mdash;originally, as Mr. Frazer shows, an annually
      slain man-god, afterwards put to death and bewailed in effigy, after a
      fashion of which we shall see not a few examples in the sequel, and of
      which the Mass itself is but an etherealised survival. Similarly in
      Phrygia, where Christianity early made a considerable impression, the most
      devoutly worshipped among the gods was Attis, who, as Professor Ramsay
      suggests, was almost certainly embodied in early times as an annually
      slain man-god, and whose cult was always carried on by means of a divine
      king-priest, bearing himself the name of Attis. Though in later days the
      priest did not actually immolate himself every year, yet on the yearly
      feast of the god, at the spring equinox (corresponding to the Christian
      Easter) he drew blood from his own arms, as a substitute no doubt for the
      earlier practice of self-slaughter. And I may add in this connexion (to
      anticipate once more) that in all such godslaughtering rites, immense
      importance was always attached to the blood of the man-god; just as in
      Christianity &ldquo;<i>the blood of Christ</i>&rdquo; remains to the end
      of most saving efficacy. Both Adonis and Attis were conceived as young men
      in the prime of life, like the victims chosen for other god-slaying rites.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have dealt in this chapter only in very brief summary with this vast and
      interesting question of human deities. Mr. Frazer has devoted to it two
      large and fascinating volumes. His work is filled with endless facts as to
      such man-gods themselves, the mode of their vicarious or expiatory
      slaughter on behalf of the community, the gentler substitution of
      condemned criminals for the divine kings in more civilised countries, the
      occasional mitigation whereby the divine king merely draws his own blood
      instead <span class="pagenum">246</span><a name="link246" id="link246"></a>of
      killing himself, or where an effigy is made to take the place of the
      actual victim, and so forth <i>ad infinitum</i>. All these valuable
      suggestions and ideas I could not reproduce here without transcribing in
      full many pages of <i>The Golden Bough</i>, where Mr. Frazer has
      marshalled the entire evidence on the point with surprising effectiveness.
      I will content myself therefore by merely referring readers to that most
      learned yet interesting and amusing book. I will only say in conclusion
      that what most concerns us here is Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s ample and convincing
      proof of the large part played by such slain (and rerisen) man-gods in the
      religion of those self-same east-Mediterranean countries where
      Christianity was first evolved as a natural product of the popular
      imagination. The death and resurrection of the humanly-embodied god form
      indeed the keynote of the greatest and most sacred religions of western
      Asia and northeastern Africa.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;THE MANUFACTURE OF GODS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ormally <span
      class="pagenum">247</span><a name="link247" id="link247"></a>and
      originally, I believe, all gods grow spontaneously. They evolve by degrees
      out of dead and deified ancestors or chieftains. The household gods are
      the dead of the family; the greater gods are the dead chiefs of the state
      or town or village. But upon this earlier and spontaneous crop of gods
      there supervenes later an artificial crop, deliberately manufactured. The
      importance of this later artificial class is so great, especially in
      connexion with the gods of agriculture, and with the habit of eating the
      god&rsquo;s body as corn and drinking his blood as wine, that it becomes
      necessary for us here to examine their nature in due order. We shall find
      that some knowledge of them is needed preliminary to the comprehension of
      the Christian system.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw that in West Africa the belief in another world is so
      matter-of-fact and material that a chief who wishes to communicate with
      his dead father kills a slave as a messenger, after first impressing upon
      him the nature of the message he will have to deliver. If he forgets
      anything, says Mr. Duff Macdonald, he kills a second and sends him after
      &ldquo;as a postscript.&rdquo; A Khond desired to be avenged upon an
      enemy; so he cut off the head of his mother, who cheerfully suggested this
      domestic arrangement, in order that her ghost might haunt and terrify the
      offender. Similar plenitude of belief in the actuality and nearness of the
      Other World makes attendants, wives, and even friends of a dead man, in
      many countries, volunteer to kill themselves <span class="pagenum">248</span><a
      name="link248" id="link248"></a>at his funeral, in order that they may
      accompany their lord and master to the nether realms. All these examples
      combine to show us two things: first, that the other life is very real and
      close to the people who behave so; and second, that no great unwillingness
      habitually exists to migration from this life to the next, if occasion
      demands it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting with such ideas, it is not surprising that many races should have
      deliberately made for themselves gods by killing a man, and especially a
      man of divine or kingly blood, the embodiment of a god, in order that his
      spirit might perform some specific divine function. Nor is it even
      remarkable that the victim selected for such a purpose should voluntarily
      submit to death, often preceded by violent torture, so as to attain in the
      end to a position of trust and importance as a tutelary deity. We have
      only to remember the ease with which Mahommedan fanatics will face death,
      expecting to enjoy the pleasures of Paradise, or the fervour with which
      Christian believers used to embrace the crown of martyrdom, in order to
      convince ourselves of the reality and profundity of such a sentiment. The
      further back we go in time or culture, the stronger does the sentiment in
      question become; <i>it is only the civilised and sceptical thinker who
      hesitates to exchange the solid comforts of this world for the shadowy and
      uncertain delights of the next</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The existence of such artificially-manufactured gods has been more or less
      recognised for some time past, and attention has been called to one or
      other class of them by Mr. Baring Gould and Mr. J. G. Frazer; but I
      believe the present work will be the first in which their profound
      importance and their place in the genesis of the higher religions has been
      fully pointed out in systematic detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best known instances of such deliberate godmaking are those which
      refer to the foundation of cities, city walls, and houses. In such cases,
      a human victim is often sacrificed in order that his blood may be used as
      cement, <span class="pagenum">249</span><a name="link249" id="link249"></a>and
      his soul be built in to the very stones of the fabric. Thereafter he
      becomes the tutelary deity or &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; of the house or city.
      In many cases, the victim offers himself voluntarily for the purpose;
      frequently he is of kingly or divine ancestry. As a sheep before her
      shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth. In Polynesia, where we
      usually stand nearest to the very core of religion, Ellis heard that the
      central pillar of the temple at Mæva was planted upon the body of a human
      victim. Among the Dyaks of Borneo, a slave girl was crushed to death under
      the first post of a house. In October 1881, the king of Ashanti put fifty
      girls to death that their blood might be mixed with the &ldquo;swish&rdquo;
      or mud used in the repair of the royal buildings. Even in Japan, a couple
      of centuries since, when a great wall was to be built, &ldquo;some
      wretched slave would offer himself as a foundation.&rdquo; Observe in this
      instance the important fact that the immolation was purely voluntary. Mr.
      Tylor, it is true, treats most of these cases as though the victim were
      intended to appease the earth-demons, which is the natural interpretation
      for the elder school of thinkers to put upon such ceremonies; but those
      who have read Mr. Frazer and Mr. Baring Gould will know that the offering
      is really a piece of deliberate god-making. Many of the original
      witnesses, indeed, correctly report this intention on the part of the
      perpetrators; thus Mason was told by an eyewitness that at the building of
      the new city of Tavoy in Tennasserim &ldquo;a criminal was put in each
      post-hole to become a protecting demon&rdquo; or rather deity. So in Siam,
      when a new city gate was being erected, says Mr. Speth, officers seized
      the first four or eight people who passed, and buried them under it
      &ldquo;as guardian angels.&rdquo; And in Roumania a <i>stahic</i> is
      defined as &ldquo;the ghost of a person who has been immured in the walls
      of a building in order to make it more solid.&rdquo; The Irish Banshee is
      doubtless of similar origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other curious examples are reported from Africa. In Galam, <span
      class="pagenum">250</span><a name="link250" id="link250"></a>a boy and
      girl used to be buried alive before the great gate of a city, to make it
      impregnable; and I gather here that the sacrifice was periodically
      renewed, as we shall see it to have been in many other cases. In Great
      Bassam and Yarriba, similar sacrifices were usual at the foundation of a
      house or village. Clearly the idea in these cases was to supply the site
      with a tutelary deity, a god whose existence was bound up with the place
      thus consecrated to him. He and the town henceforth were one; he was its
      soul, and it was his body. Human victims are said to have been buried
      &ldquo;for spirit-watchers&rdquo; under the gates of Mandelay. So too,
      according to legend, here a tolerably safe guide, a queen was drowned in a
      Burmese reservoir, to make the dyke safe; while the choice for such a
      purpose of a royal victim shows clearly the desirability of divine blood
      being present in the body of the future deity. When Rajah Sala Byne was
      building the fort of Sialkot in the Punjaub, the foundation gave way so
      often that he consulted a soothsayer. The soothsayer advised that the
      blood of an only son should be shed on the spot; and the only son of a
      widow was accordingly killed there. I may add that the blood of &ldquo;<i>an
      only-begotten son</i>&rdquo; has always been held to possess peculiar
      efficacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Europe itself, not a few traces survive of such foundation-gods, or
      spirits of towns, town-walls, and houses. The Piets are said to have
      bathed their foundation-stones in human blood, especially in building
      their forts and castles. St. Columba himself, though nominally a
      Christian, did not scruple thus to secure the safety of his monastery.
      Columbkille said to his people, &ldquo;&lsquo;It would be well for us that
      our roots should pass into the earth here.&rsquo; And he said to them,
      &lsquo;It is permitted to you that some one of you go under the earth to
      consecrate it.&rsquo;&rdquo; St. Oran volunteered to accept the task, and
      was ever after honoured as the patron saint of the monastery. Here again
      it may be noted that the offering was voluntary. As late as 1463, when the
      broken dam of the Nogat had to be repaired, <span class="pagenum">251</span><a
      name="link251" id="link251"></a>the peasants, being advised to throw in a
      living man, are said to have made a beggar drunk (in which state he would
      of course be &ldquo;full of the god&rdquo;) and utilised him for the
      purpose. In 1885, on the restoration of Hols-worthy church in Devon, a
      skeleton with a mass of mortar plastered over the mouth was found embedded
      in an angle of the building. To make the castle of Liebenstein fast and
      impregnable, a child was bought for hard money of its mother, and walled
      into the building. Again, when the church at Blex in Oldenburg was being
      built, the authorities of the village crossed the Weser, &ldquo;bought a
      child from a poor mother at Bremerleke, and built it alive into the
      foundations.&rdquo; We shall see hereafter that &ldquo;to be brought with
      a price&rdquo; is a variant, as it were, on the voluntary offering; great
      stress is often laid when a victim is offered on this particular fact,
      which is held to absolve the perpetrators from the crime of god-murder.
      So, we shall see in the sequel, the divine animal-victim, which is the god
      offered to himself, his animal embodiment to his image or altar, must
      always consent to its own sacrifice; if it refuse or show the slightest
      disinclination, it is no good victim. Legend says that the child in the
      case of the Liebenstein offering was beguiled with a cake, probably so as
      to make it a consenting party, and was slowly walled up before the eyes of
      the mother. All these details are full of incidental instructiveness and
      importance. As late as 1865, according to Mr. Speth, some Christian
      labourers, working at a-block-house at Duga, near Scutari, found two young
      Christian children in the hands of Mahommedan Arnauts, who were trying to
      bury them alive under the block-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is about city walls, however, that we oftenest read such legendary
      stories. Thus the wall of Copenhagen sank as fast as it was built; so they
      took an innocent little girl, and set her at a table with toys and
      eatables. Then, while she played and eat, twelve master masons closed a
      vault over her. With clanging music, to drown the child&rsquo;s cries,
      <span class="pagenum">252</span><a name="link252" id="link252"></a>the
      wall was raised, and stood fast ever after. In Italy, once more, the
      bridge of Arta fell in, time after time, till they walled in the master
      builder&rsquo;s wife; the last point being a significant detail, whose
      meaning will come out still more clearly in the sequel. At Scutari in
      Servia, once more, the fortress could only be satisfactorily built after a
      human victim was walled into it; so the three brothers who wrought at it
      decided to offer up the first of their wives who came to the place to
      bring them food. (Compare the case of Jephtha&rsquo;s daughter, where the
      first living thing met by chance is to be sacrificed to Jahweh.) So, too,
      in Welsh legend, Vortigern could not finish his tower till the
      foundation-stone was wetted with &ldquo;<i>the blood of a child born of a
      mother without a father&rdquo;&mdash;this episode of the virgin-born
      infant being a common element in the generation of man-gods</i>, as Mr.
      Sidney Hartland has abundantly proved for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one case cited above, we saw a mitigation of the primitive custom, in
      that a criminal was substituted for a person of royal blood or divine
      origin&mdash;a form of substitution of which Mr. Frazer has supplied
      abundant examples in other connexions. Still further mitigations are those
      of building-in a person who has committed sacrilege or broken some
      religious vow of chastity. In the museum at Algiers is a plaster cast of
      the mould left by the body of one Geronimo, a Moorish Christian (and
      therefore a recusant of Islam), who was built into a block of concrete in
      the angle of the fort in the sixteenth century. Faithless nuns were so
      immured in Europe during the middle ages; and Mr. Rider Haggard&rsquo;s
      statement that he saw in the museum at Mexico bodies similarly immured by
      the Inquisition has roused so much Catholic wrath and denial that one can
      hardly have any hesitation in accepting its substantial accuracy. But in
      other cases, the substitution has gone further still; instead of
      criminals, recusants, or heretics, we get an animal victim in place of the
      human one. Mr. St. John saw a chicken sacrificed for a slave girl <span
      class="pagenum">253</span><a name="link253" id="link253"></a>at a building
      among the Dyaks of Borneo. A lamb was walled-in under the altar of a
      church in Denmark, to make it stand fast; or the churchyard was hanselled
      by burying first a live horse, an obvious parallel to the case of St Oran.
      When the parish church of Chumleigh in Devonshire was taken down a few
      years ago, in a wall of the fifteenth century was found a carved figure of
      Christ, crucified to a vine&mdash;a form of substitution to which we shall
      find several equivalents later. In modern Greece, says Dr. Tylor, to whom
      I owe many of these instances, a relic of the idea survives in the belief
      that the first passer-by after a foundation-stone is laid will die within
      the year; so the masons compromise the matter by killing a cock or a black
      lamb on the foundation-stone. This animal then becomes the spirit of the
      building.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall see reason to suspect, as we proceed, that every slaughtered
      victim in every rite was at first a divine-human being; and that animal
      victims are always substitutes, though supposed to be equally divine with
      the man-god they personate. I will ask the reader to look out for such
      cases as we proceed, and also to notice, even when I do not call attention
      to them, the destination of the oracular head, and the frequent
      accompaniment of &ldquo;clanging music.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsewhere we find other customs which help to explain these curious
      survivals. The shadow is often identified with the soul; and in Roumania,
      when a new building is to be erected, the masons endeavour to catch the
      shadow of a passing stranger, and then lay the foundation-stone upon it.
      Or the stranger is enticed by stealth to the stone, when the mason
      secretly measures his body or his shadow, and buries the measure thus
      taken under the foundation. Here we have a survival of the idea that the
      victim must at least be not unwilling. It is believed that the person thus
      measured will languish and die within forty days; and we may be sure that
      originally the belief ran that his soul became the god or guardian spirit
      of the edifice. <span class="pagenum">254</span><a name="link254"
      id="link254"></a>If the Bulgarians cannot get a human shadow to wall in,
      they content themselves with the shadow of the first animal that passes
      by. Here again we get that form of divine chance in the pointing out of a
      victim which is seen in the case of Jephtha&rsquo;s daughter. Still milder
      substitutions occur in the empty coffin walled into a church in Germany,
      or the rude images of babies in swaddling-clothes similarly immured in
      Holland. The last trace of the custom is found in England in the modern
      practice of putting coins and newspapers under the foundation-stone. Here
      it would seem as if the victim were regarded as a sacrifice to the Earth
      (a late and derivative idea), and the coins were a money payment in lieu
      of the human or animal offering. I owe many of the cases here instanced to
      the careful research of my friend Mr. Clodd. But since this chapter was
      written, all other treatises on the subject have been superseded by Mr.
      Speth&rsquo;s exhaustive and scholarly pamphlet on &ldquo;Builder&rsquo;s
      Rites and Ceremonies,&rdquo; a few examples from which I have intercalated
      in my argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other implications must be briefly treated. The best ghost or god for this
      purpose seems to be a divine or kingly person; and in stages when the
      meaning of the practice is still quite clear to the builders, the
      dearly-be-loved son or wife of the king is often selected for the honour
      of tutelary godship. Later this notion passes into the sacrifice of the
      child or wife of the master mason; many legends or traditions contain this
      more recent element. In Vortigern&rsquo;s case, however, the child is
      clearly a divine being, as we shall see to be true a little later on in
      certain Semitic instances. To the last, the connexion of children with
      such sacrifices is most marked; thus when in 1813 the ice on the Elbe
      broke down one of the dams, an old peasant sneered at the efforts of the
      Government engineer, saying to him, &ldquo;You will never get the dyke to
      hold unless you first sink an innocent child under the foundations.&rdquo;
      Here the very epithet &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; in itself reveals some last
      <span class="pagenum">255</span><a name="link255" id="link255"></a>echo of
      godship. So too, in 1843, when a new bridge was to be built at Halle in
      Germany, the people told the architects that the pier would not stand
      unless a living child was immured under the foundations. Schrader says
      that when the great railway bridge over the Ganges was begun, every mother
      in Bengal trembled for her infant. The Slavonic chiefs who founded Detinez
      sent out men to catch the first boy they met and bury him in the
      foundation. Here once more we have the sacred-chance victim. Briefly I
      would say there seems to be a preference in all such cases for children,
      and especially for girls; of kingly stock, if possible, but at least a
      near relation of the master builder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speth points out that horses&rsquo; heads were frequently fastened on
      churches or other buildings, and suggests that they belong to animal
      foundation-victims. This use of the skull is in strict accordance with its
      usual oracular destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some notable historical or mythical tales of town and village gods,
      deliberately manufactured, may now be considered. We read in First Kings
      that when Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho, &ldquo;he laid the foundation
      thereof in Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates thereof in his
      youngest Segub.&rdquo; Here we see evidently a princely master builder,
      sacrificing his own two sons as guardian gods of his new city. Abundant
      traces exist of such deliberate production of a Fortune for a town. And it
      is also probable that the original sacrifice was repeated annually, as if
      to keep up the constant stream of divine life, somewhat after the fashion
      of the human gods we had to consider in the last chapter. Dido appears to
      have been the Fortune or foundation-goddess of Carthage; she is
      represented in the legend as the foundress-queen, and is said to have lept
      into her divine pyre from the walls of her palace. But the annual human
      sacrifice appears to have been performed at the same place; for &ldquo;It
      can hardly be doubted,&rdquo; says Professor Robertson Smith, &ldquo;that
      <span class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256" id="link256"></a>the
      spot at which legend placed the self-sacrifice of Dido to her husband
      Sicharbas was that at which the later Carthaginian human sacrifices were
      performed.&rdquo; At Laodicea, again, an annual sacrifice took place of a
      deer, in lieu of a maiden; and this sacrifice, we are expressly told, was
      offered to the goddess of the city. Legend said that the goddess was a
      maiden, who had been similarly sacrificed to consecrate the foundation of
      the town, and was thenceforth worshipped as its Fortune, like Dido at
      Carthage; &ldquo;it was therefore the death of the goddess herself,&rdquo;
      says Professor Robertson Smith, &ldquo;that was annually renewed in the
      piacular rite.&rdquo; (I do not admit the justice of the epithet &ldquo;piacular.&rdquo;)
      Again, Malalas tells us that the 22d of May was kept at Antioch as the
      anniversary of a maiden sacrificed at the foundation of the city, and
      worshipped thereafter as the Tyche, or luck, of the town. At Durna in
      Arabia an annual victim was similarly buried under the stone which formed
      the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most of the legends, as they come down to us from civilised and
      lettered antiquity, the true nature of this sanguinary foundation-rite is
      overlaid and disguised by later rationalising guesses and I may mention
      that Dr. Robertson Smith in particular habitually treats the rationalising
      guesses as primitive, and the real old tradition of the slaughtered virgin
      as a myth of explanation of &ldquo;the later Euhemeristic Syrians.&rdquo;
      But after the examples we have already seen of foundation-gods, I think I
      can hardly be doubted that this is to reverse the true order; that a girl
      was really sacrificed for a tutelary deity when a town was founded, and
      that the substitution of an animal victim at the annual renewal was a
      later refinement. Mr. Speth quotes a case in point of a popular tradition
      that a young girl had been built into the castle of Nieder-Manderschied;
      and when the wall was opened in 1844, the Euhemeristic workmen found a
      cavity enclosing a human skeleton. I would suggest, again, that in the
      original legend of the foundation of Rome, Romulus was represented as
      having built-in <span class="pagenum">257</span><a name="link257"
      id="link257"></a>his brother Remus as a Fortune, or god, of the city, and
      that to this identification of Remus with the city we ought to trace such
      phrases as <i>turba Remi</i> for the Roman people. The word <i>forum</i>
      in its primitive signification means the empty space left before a tomb&mdash;the
      <i>llan</i> or <i>temenos</i>. Hence I would suggest that the Roman Forum
      and other Latin <i>fora</i> were really the tomb-enclosures of the
      original foundation-victims. * So, too, the English village green and
      &ldquo;play-field&rdquo; are probably the space dedicated to the tribal or
      village god&mdash;a slain man-god; and they are usually connected with the
      sacred stone and sacred tree. I trust this point will become clearer as we
      proceed, and develop the whole theory of the foundation god or goddess,
      the allied sacred stone and the tree or trunk memorial.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In the case of Rome, the Forum would represent the grave
     of the later foundation-god of the compound Latin and Sabine
     city.
</pre>
    <p>
      For, if I am right, the entire primitive ritual of the foundation of a
      village consisted in killing or burying alive or building into the wall a
      human victim, as town or village god, and raising a stone and planting a
      tree close by to commemorate him. At these two monuments the village rites
      were thereafter performed. The stone and tree are thus found in their
      usual conjunction; both coexist in the Indian village to the present day,
      as in the Siberian woodland or the Slavonic forest. Thus, at Rome, we have
      not only the legend of the death of Remus, a prince of the blood-royal of
      Alba Longa, intimately connected with the building of the wall of Roma
      Quadrata, but we have also the sacred fig-tree of Romulus in the Forum,
      which was regarded as the embodiment of the city life of the combined
      Rome, so that when it showed signs of withering, consternation spread
      through the city; and hard by we have the sacred stone or Palladium,
      guarded by the sacred Vestal Virgins who kept the city hearth-fire, and
      still more closely bound up with the fortune of that secondary Rome which
      had its home in the Forum. Are not these three the <span class="pagenum">258</span><a
      name="link258" id="link258"></a>triple form of the foundation-god of that
      united Capitoline and Palatine Rome? And may not the sacred cornel on the
      Palatine, again, have been similarly the holy foundation-tree of that
      older Roma Ouadrata which is more particularly associated with the name of
      Romulus? Of this tree Plutarch tells us that when it appeared to a
      passer-by to be drooping, he set up a hue and cry, which was soon
      responded to by people on all sides rushing up with buckets of water to
      pour upon it, as if they were hastening to put out a fire. Clearly, here
      again we have to deal with an embodied Fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not often get all three of these Fortunes combined&mdash;the human
      victim, the stone, and the tree, with the annual offering which renews its
      sanctity. But we find traces so often of one or other of the trio that we
      are justified, I think, in connecting them together as parts of a whole,
      whereof here one element survives, and there another. &ldquo;Among all
      primitive communities,&rdquo; says Mr. Gomme, &ldquo;when a village was
      first established, a stone was set up. To this stone, the headman of the
      village made an offering once a year.&rdquo; To the present day, London
      preserves her foundation-god in the shape of London Stone, now enclosed in
      a railing or iron grill just opposite Cannon Street Station. Now, London
      Stone was for ages considered as the representative and embodiment of the
      entire community. Proclamations and other important state businesses were
      announced from its top; and the defendant in trials in the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
      court was summoned to attend from London Stone, as though the stone itself
      spoke to the wrong-doer with the united voice of the assembled citizens.
      The first Lord Mayor, indeed, was Henry de Lundonstone, no doubt, as Mr.
      Loftie suggests, the hereditary keeper of this urban fetish,&mdash;in
      short, the representative of the village headman. I have written at
      greater length on the implications of this interesting relic in an article
      on London Stone in <i>Longman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, to which I would refer
      the reader for further information. <span class="pagenum">259</span><a
      name="link259" id="link259"></a>I will only add here the curious episode
      of Jack Cade, who, when he forced his way, under his assumed name of
      Mortimer, into the city in 1450, first of all proceeded to this sacred
      relic, the embodiment of palladium of ancient London, and having struck it
      with his sword exclaimed, &ldquo;Now is Mortimer lord of this city.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar sacred stone exists to this day at Bovey Tracey in Devon, of
      which Ormerod tells us that the mayor of Bovey used to ride round it on
      the first day of his tenure of office, and strike it with a stick,&mdash;which
      further explains Jack Cade&rsquo;s proceeding. According to the Totnes
      Times of May 13, 1882, the young men of the town were compelled on the
      same day to kiss the magic stone and pledge allegiance in upholding the
      ancient rights and privileges of Bovey. (I owe these details to Mr.
      Lawrence Gomme&rsquo;s Village Community.) I do not think we can
      dissociate from these two cases the other sacred stones of Britain, such
      as the King&rsquo;s Stone at Kingston in Surrey, where several of the West
      Saxon kings were crowned; nor the Scone Stone in the coronation-chair at
      Westminster Abbey; nor the Stone of Clackmannan, and the sacred stones
      already mentioned in a previous chapter on which the heads of clans or of
      Irish septs succeeded to the chieftainship of their respective families.
      These may in part have been ancestral and sepulchral monuments: but it is
      probable that they also partook in part of this artificial and factitious
      sanctity. Certainly in some cases that sanctity was renewed by an animal
      sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these fairly obvious instances I would also connect certain other
      statements which seem to me to have been hitherto misinterpreted. Thus
      Mesha, king of Moab, when he is close beleaguered, burns his son as a
      holocaust on the wall of the city. Is not this an offering to protect the
      wall by the deliberate manufacture of an additional deity? For straightway
      the besiegers seem to feel they are overpowered, and the siege is raised.
      Observe <span class="pagenum">260</span><a name="link260" id="link260"></a>here
      once more that it is the king&rsquo;s own dearly-be-loved son who is
      chosen as victim. Again, at Amathus, human sacrifices were offered to
      Jupiter Hospes &ldquo;before the gates&rdquo;; and this Jupiter Hospes, as
      Ovid calls him, is the Amathusian Herakles or Malika, whose name,
      preserved for us by Hesychius, identifies him at once as a local deity
      similar to the Tyrian Melcarth. Was not this again, therefore, the Fortune
      of the city? At Tyre itself, the sepulchre of Herakles Melcarth was shown,
      where he was said to have been cremated. For among cremating peoples it
      was natural to burn, not slaughter, the yearly god-victim. At Tarsus, once
      more, there was an annual feast, at which a very fair pyre was erected,
      and the local Herakles or Baal was burned on it in effigy. We cannot
      doubt, I think, that this was a mitigation of an earlier human holocaust.
      Indeed, Dr. Robertson Smith says of this instance: &ldquo;This annual
      commemoration of the death of the god in fire must have its origin in an
      older rite, in which the victim was not a mere effigy, but a theanthropic
      sacrifice, i.e., an actual man or sacred animal, whose life, according to
      the antique conception now familiar to us, was an embodiment of the
      divine-human life.&rdquo; This is very near my own view on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these instances we may proceed, I think, to a more curious set, whose
      implications seem to me to have been even more grievously mistaken by
      later interpreters. I mean the case of children of kings or of ruling
      families, sacrificed in time of war or peril as additional or auxiliary
      deities. Thus Philo of Byblos says: &ldquo;It was an ancient custom in a
      crisis of great danger that the ruler of a city or nation should give his
      beloved son to die for the whole people, as a ransom offered to the
      avenging demons; and the children thus offered were slain with mystic
      rites. So Cronus, whom the Phoenicians call Israel, being king of the
      land, and having an only-begotten son called Jeoud (for in the Phoenicians
      tongue Jeoud signifies only-begotten), dressed him in royal robes and
      sacrificed him upon an altar <span class="pagenum">261</span><a
      name="link261" id="link261"></a>in a time of war, when the country was in
      great danger from the enemy.&rdquo; I do not think Philo is right in his
      gloss or guess about &ldquo;the avenging demons,&rdquo; but otherwise his
      story is interesting evidence. It helps us more or less directly to
      connect the common Phoenician and Hebrew child-sacrifices with this
      deliberate manufacture of artificial gods. I do not doubt, indeed, that
      the children were partly sacrificed to pre-existent and well-defined great
      gods; but I believe also that the practice first arose as one of
      deliberate manufacture of gods, and retained to the end many traces of its
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that in times of national calamity the Phoenicians used thus to
      sacrifice their dearest to Baal. Phoenician history, we know from
      Porphyry, is full of such sacrifices. When the Carthaginians were defeated
      and besieged by Agathocles, they ascribed their disasters to the anger of
      the god; for whereas in former times they used to sacrifice to him their
      own children, they had latterly fallen (as we shall see hereafter the
      Khonds did) into the habit of buying children and rearing them as victims.
      So two hundred young people of the noblest families were picked out for
      sacrifice; and these were accompanied by no less than three hundred more,
      who volunteered to die for the fatherland. They were sacrificed by being
      placed, one by one, on the sloping hands of the brazen image, from which
      they rolled into a pit of fire. So too at Jerusalem, in moments of great
      danger, children were sacrificed to some Molech, whether Jahweh or
      another, by being placed in the fiery arms of the image at the Tophet. I
      will admit that in these last cases we approach very near to the mere
      piacular human sacrifice; but we shall see, when we come to deal with gods
      of cultivation, and the doctrine of the atonement, that it is difficult to
      draw a line between the two; while the fact that a dearly-beloved or
      only-begotten son is the victim&mdash;especially the son of a king of
      divine blood&mdash;links such cases on directly to the more obvious
      instances of deliberate god-making. Some such voluntary sacrifice <span
      class="pagenum">262</span><a name="link262" id="link262"></a>seems to me
      to be commemorated in the beautiful imagery of the 53d of Isaiah. But
      there the language is distinctly piacular.
    </p>
    <p>
      That annual human sacrifices originated in deliberate god-making of this
      sort is an inference which has already been almost arrived at by more
      orthodox thinkers. &ldquo;Among the Semites,&rdquo; says Dr. Robertson
      Smith, &ldquo;the most current view of annual piacula seems to have been
      that they commemorate a divine tragedy&mdash;the death of some god or
      goddess. The origin of such myths is easily explained from the nature of
      the ritual. Originally, the death of the god was nothing else than the
      death of the theanthropic victim; but when this ceased to be understood,
      it was thought that the piacular sacrifice represented an historical
      tragedy in which the god was killed.&rdquo; But we shall see hereafter
      that the idea of expiation in sacrifice is quite a late and derivative
      one; it seems more probable that the victim was at first a human god, for
      whom later an animal victim was substituted. In the Athenian Thar-gelia,
      the victims were human to the very end, though undoubtedly they were
      thought of as bearing vicariously the sins of the people. We shall come
      across similar intrusions of the idea of expiation in later chapters; that
      idea belongs to a stage of thought when men considered it necessary to
      explain away by some ethical reference the sanguinary element of primitive
      ritual. Thus in two Greek towns, as we learn from Pausanias&mdash;at
      Potniæ and Patræ,&mdash;an annual sacrifice existed which had once been
      the sacrifice of a human victim; but this was later explained as an
      expiation of an ancient crime for which satisfaction had to be made from
      generation to generation. Indeed, as a rule, later ages looked upon the
      murder of a god as obviously criminal, and therefore regarded the
      slaughter of the victim, who replaced the god, as being an atonement for
      his death, instead of regarding it as a deliberate release of his divine
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have dwelt here mainly on that particular form of artificial <span
      class="pagenum">263</span><a name="link263" id="link263"></a>god-making
      which is concerned with the foundation of houses, villages, cities, walls,
      and fortresses, because this is the commonest and most striking case,
      outside agriculture, and because it is specially connected with the
      world-wide institution of the village or city god. But other types occur
      in abundance; and to them a few lines must now be devoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a ship was launched, it was a common practice to provide her with a
      guardian spirit or god by making her roll over the body of a human victim.
      The Norwegian vikings used to &ldquo;redden their rollers&rdquo; with
      human blood. That is to say, when a warship was launched, human victims
      were lashed to the round logs over which the galley was run down to the
      sea, so that the stem was sprinkled with their spurting blood. Thus the
      victim was incorporated, as it were, in the very planks of the vessel.
      Captain Cook found the South Sea Islanders similarly christening their
      war-canoes with blood. In 1784, says Mr. William Simpson, at the launching
      of one of the Bey of Tripoli&rsquo;s cruisers, &ldquo;a black slave was
      led forward and fastened at the prow of the vessel to influence a happy
      reception in the ocean.&rdquo; And Mr. Speth quotes a newspaper account of
      the sacrifice of a sheep when the first caique for &ldquo;Constantinople
      at Olympia&rdquo; was launched in the Bosphorus. In many other cases, it
      is noted that a victim, human or animal, is slaughtered at the launching
      of a ship. Our own ceremony of breaking a bottle of wine over the bows is
      the last relic of this barbarous practice. Here as elsewhere red wine does
      duty for blood, in virtue of its colour. I do not doubt that the images of
      gods in the bow of a ship were originally idols in which the spirits thus
      liberated might dwell, and that it was to them the sailors prayed for
      assistance in storm or peril. The god was bound up in the very fabric of
      the vessel. The modern figure-head still represents these gods;
      figure-heads essentially similar to the domestic idols occur on New
      Zealand and Polynesian war-canoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">264</span><a name="link264" id="link264"></a>canoes
      of the Solomon Islanders, for example, &ldquo;often have as figure-head a
      carved representation of the upper half of a man, who holds in his hands a
      human head.&rdquo; This head, known as the &ldquo;canoe-god&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;charm,&rdquo; &ldquo;represents the life taken when the canoe was
      first used.&rdquo; A canoe of importance &ldquo;required a life for its
      inauguration,&rdquo; says Dr. Codrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another curious instance is to be found in the customs and beliefs
      regarding river gods. Rivers, I have suggested, are often divine because
      they spring near or are connected with the grave of a hero. But often
      their divinity has been deliberately given them, and is annually renewed
      by a god-making sacrifice: just as at the Jewish Passover an annual
      animal-victim was slain, and his blood smeared on the lintels, as a
      renewal of the foundation sacrifice. The best instance I have found of
      this curious custom is one cited by Mr. Gomme from Major Ellis. Along the
      banks of the Prah in West Africa there are many deities, all bearing the
      common name of Prah, and all regarded as spirits of the river. At each
      town or considerable village along the stream, a sacrifice is held on a
      day about the middle of October. The usual sacrifice was two human adults,
      one male and one female. The inhabitants of each village believe in a
      separate spirit of the Prah, who resides in some part of the river close
      to their own hamlet. Everywhere along the river the priests of these gods
      officiate in groups of three, two male and one female, an arrangement
      which is peculiar to the river gods. Here, unless I mistake, we have an
      obvious case of deliberate god-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      This savage instance, and others like it, which space precludes me from
      detailing, suggest the conclusion that many river gods are of artificial
      origin. The Wohhanda in Esthonia received offerings of little children,
      whom we may fairly compare with the children immured in buildings or
      offered to the Molech. Many other rivers spontaneously <span
      class="pagenum">265</span><a name="link265" id="link265"></a>take their
      victim annually; thus the Devonshire rhyme goes,=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;River
      of Dart, river of Dart,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every
      year thou claimest a heart.=
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spey also takes one life each year, and so do several British rivers
      elsewhere. Originally, no doubt, the victim was deliberately chosen and
      slain annually; but later on, as a mitigation of the custom, the river
      itself seems to have selected its own spirit by divine chance, such as we
      have already seen in action more than once in the earlier cases. In other
      words, if a passer-by happened to be accidentally drowned, he was accepted
      in place of a deliberate victim. * Hence the danger of rescuing a man from
      drowning; you interfere with the course of divine selection, and you will
      pay for it yourself by being the next victim. &ldquo;When, in the Solomon
      Islands, a man accidentally falls into a river, and a shark attacks him,
      he is not allowed to escape. If he succeeds in eluding the shark, his
      fellow-tribesmen throw him back to his doom, believing him to be marked
      out for sacrifice to the god of the river.&rdquo; Similarly, in Britain
      itself, the Lancashire Ribble has a water-spirit called Peg o&rsquo; Nell,
      represented by a stone image, now headless, which stands at the spring
      where the river rises in the grounds of Waddon. (Compare the Adonis tomb
      and grove by the spring at Aphaca.) This Peg o&rsquo; Nell was originally,
      according to tradition, a girl of the neighbourhood; but she was done to
      death by incantations, and now demands every seven years that a life
      should be quenched in the waters of the Ribble. When &ldquo;Peg&rsquo;s
      night&rdquo; came round at the close of the septennate, unless a bird, a
      cat, or a dog was drowned in the river, it was sure to claim its human
      victim. This name of Peg is evidently a corruption of some old local
      Celtic or pre-Celtic word <span class="pagenum">266</span><a name="link266"
      id="link266"></a>for a nymph or water-spirit; for there is another Peg in
      the Tees, known as Peg Powler; and children used there to be warned
      against playing on the banks of the stream, for fear Peg should drag them
      into the water. Such traces of a child-sacrifice are extremely
      significant.
    </p>

     * Here is an analogue in foundation sacrifices. A house was
     being built at Hind Head while this book was in progress. A
     workman fell from a beam and was killed. The other workmen
     declared this was luck for the house and would ensure its
     stability.
</pre>
    <p>
      I cannot do more than suggest here in passing that we have in these
      stories and practices the most probable origin of the common myth which
      accounts for the existence of river gods or river nymphs by some episode
      of a youth or maiden drowned there. Arethusa is the example that occurs to
      everyone. Grossly Euhemeristic as it may sound to say so, I yet believe
      that such myths of metamorphosis have their origin in the deliberate
      manufacture of a water-deity by immolation in the stream; and that the
      annual renewal of such a sacrifice was due in part to the desire to keep
      alive the memory of the gods&mdash;to be sure they were there, to make
      them &ldquo;fresh and fresh,&rdquo; if one may venture to say so&mdash;and
      in part to the analogy of those very important artificial gods of
      agriculture whose origin and meaning we have still to consider. I would
      add that the commonness of sea-horses and river-horses in the mythology of
      the world doubtless owes its origin partly to the natural idea of &ldquo;white
      horses&rdquo; on the waves, but partly also to the deliberate sacrifice of
      horses to the sea or rivers, which this notion suggested, and which tended
      to intensify it. It is as though the worshipper wished to keep up a
      continuous supply of such divine and ghostly steeds. At Rhodes, for
      example, four horses were annually cast into the sea; and I need hardly
      refer to the conventional horses of Poseidon and Neptune. The Ugly Burn in
      Ross-shire is the abode of a water-horse; in the remains of the Roman
      temple at Lydney, the god Nodens, who represents the Severn, is shown in
      the mosaic pavement as drawn in a chariot by four horses; and the Yore,
      near Middleham, is still infested by a water-horse who annually claims at
      least one human victim. Elsewhere other animals take the place of the
      horse. The Ostyaks <span class="pagenum">267</span><a name="link267"
      id="link267"></a>sacrifice to the river Ob by casting in a live reindeer
      when fish are scanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not deny that in many of these cases two distinct ideas&mdash;the
      earlier idea of the victim as future god, and the later idea of the victim
      as prey or sacrifice&mdash;have got inextricably mixed up; but I do think
      enough&rsquo; has been said to suggest the probability that many
      river-gods are artificially produced, and that this is in large part the
      origin of nymphs and kelpies. Legend, indeed, almost always represents
      them so; it is only our mythologists, with their blind hatred of
      Euhemerism, who fail to perceive the obvious implication. And that even
      the accidental victim was often envisaged as a river-god, after his death,
      we see clearly from the Bohemian custom of going to pray on the river bank
      where a man has been drowned, and casting into the river a loaf of new
      bread and a pair of wax candles, obvious offerings to his spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other classes of manufactured gods seem to me to exist, whose
      existence I must here pass over almost in silence. Such are the gods
      produced at the beginning of a war, by human or other sacrifice; gods
      intended to aid the warriors in their coming enterprise by being set free
      from fleshly bonds for that very purpose. Thus, according to Phylarchus, a
      human sacrifice was at one time customary in Greece at the beginning of
      hostilities; and we know that as late as the age of Themistocles three
      captives were thus offered up before the battle of Salamis. The sacrifice
      of Iphigenia is a good legendary case in point, because it is one of a
      virgin, a princess, the daughter of the leader, and therefore a typical
      release of a divine or royal spirit. Here, as usual, later philosophising
      represents the act as an expiation for mortal guilt; but we may be sure
      the original story contained no such ethical or piacular element. Among
      the early Hebrews, the summons to a war seems similarly to have been made
      by sending round pieces of the human victim; in later Hebrew usage, this
      rite declines into the sacrifice of a burnt <span class="pagenum">268</span><a
      name="link268" id="link268"></a>offering; though we get an intermediate
      stage when Saul sends round portions of a slaughtered ox, as the Levite in
      Judges had sent round the severed limbs of his concubine to rouse the
      Israelites. In Africa, a war is still opened with a solemn sacrifice,
      human or otherwise; and Mr. H. O. Forbes gives a graphic account of the
      similar ceremony which precedes an expedition in the island of Timor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, I will only say that a great many other obscure rites or
      doubtful legends seem to me explicable by similar deliberate exercises of
      god-making. How common such sacrifice was in agricultural relations we
      shall see in the sequel; but I believe that even in other fields of life
      future research will so explain many other customs. The self-immolation of
      Codrus, of Sardanapa-lus, of P. Decius Mus, as of so many other kings or
      heroes or gods or goddesses; the divine beings who fling themselves from
      cliffs into the sea; M. Curtius devoting himself in the gulf in the Forum;
      the tombs of the lovers whom Semiramis buried alive; all these, I take it,
      have more or less similar implications. Even such tales as that of T.
      Manlius Torquatus and his son must be assimilated, I think, to the story
      of the king of Moab killing his son on the wall, or to that of the
      Carthaginians offering up their children to the offended deity; only, in
      later times, the tale was misinterpreted and used to point the supposed
      moral of the stern and inflexible old Roman discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequent reiteration of sacrifices seems necessary, also, in order to keep
      up the sanctity of images and sacred rites&mdash;to put, as it were, a new
      soul into them. Thus, rivers needed a fresh river-god every year; and
      recently in Ashantee it was discovered that a fetish would no longer
      &ldquo;work&rdquo; unless human victims were abundantly immolated for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also perhaps the proper place to observe that just as the great
      god Baal has been resolved by modern scholarship <span class="pagenum">269</span><a
      name="link269" id="link269"></a>into many local Baalim, and just as the
      great god Adonis has been reduced by recent research in each case to some
      particular Adon or lord out of many, so each such separate deity,
      artificially manufactured, though called by the common name of the Prah or
      the Tiber,&rsquo; yet retains to the last some distinct identity. In fact,
      the great gods appear to be rather classes than individuals. That there
      were many Nymphs and many Fauni, many Silvani and many Martes, has long
      been known; it is beginning to be clear that there were also many Saturns,
      many Jupiters, many Junones, many Vestæ. Even in Greece it is more than
      probable that the generalised names of the great gods were given in later
      ages to various old sacred stones and holy sites of diverse origin: the
      real object of worship was in each case the spontaneous or artificial god;
      the name was but a general title applied in common, perhaps adjectivally,
      to several such separate deities. In the Roman pantheon, this principle is
      now, quite well established; in the Semitic it is probable; in most
      others, the progress of modern research is gradually leading up to it.
      Even the elemental gods themselves do not seem in their first origin to be
      really singular; they grow, apparently, from generalised phrases, like our
      &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; and &ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; applied at first to the
      particular deity of whom at the moment the speaker is thinking. The Zeus
      or Jupiter varies with the locality. Thus, when the Latin prætor, at the
      outbreak of the Latin war, defied the Roman Jupiter, we may be sure it was
      the actual god there visible before him at whom he hurled his sacrilegious
      challenge, not the ideal deity in the sky above his head. Indeed, we now
      know that each village and each farm had a Jovis of its own, regarded as
      essentially a god of wine, and specially worshipped at the wine-feast in
      April, when the first cask was broached. This individuality of the gods is
      an important point to bear in mind; for the tendency of language is always
      to treat many similar deities as practically identical, especially in late
      <span class="pagenum">270</span><a name="link270" id="link270"></a>and
      etherealised forms of religion. And mythologists have made the most of
      this syncretic tendency.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single concrete instance will help to make this general principle yet
      clearer. Boundaries, I believe, were originally put under the charge of
      local and artificial deities, by slaughtering a human victim at each
      turning-point in the limits, and erecting a sacred stone on the spot where
      he died to preserve his memory. Often, too, in accordance with the common
      rule, a sacred tree seems to have been planted beside the sacred stone
      monument. Each such victim became forthwith a boundary god, a protecting
      and watching spirit, and was known thenceforth as a Hermes or a Terminus.
      But there were many Hermæ and many Termini, not in Greece and Italy alone,
      but throughout the world. Only much later did a generalised god, Hermes or
      Terminus, arise from the union into a single abstract concept of all these
      separate and individual deities. Once more, the boundary god was renewed
      each year by a fresh victim. Our own practice of &ldquo;beating the bounds&rdquo;
      appears to be the last expiring relic of such annual sacrifices. The
      bounds are beaten, apparently, in order to expel all foreign gods or
      hostile spirits; the boys who play a large part in the ceremony are the
      representatives of the human victims. They are whipped at each terminus
      stone, partly in order to make them shed tears as a rain-charm (after the
      fashion with which Mr. Frazer has made us familiar), but partly also
      because all artificially-made gods are scourged or tortured before being
      put to death, for some reason which I do not think we yet fully
      understand. The rationalising gloss that the boys are whipped &ldquo;in
      order to make them remember the boundaries&rdquo; is one of the usual
      shallow explanations so glibly offered by the eighteenth century. The fact
      that the ceremony takes place at sacred stones or &ldquo;Gospel oaks&rdquo;
      sufficiently proclaims its original meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea underlying Christian martyrdom, where the martyr <span
      class="pagenum">271</span><a name="link271" id="link271"></a>voluntarily
      devotes himself or herself to death in order to gain the crown and palm in
      heaven, is essentially similar to the self-immolation of the artificial
      gods, and helps to explain the nature of such self-sacrifice. For
      Christianity is only nominally a monotheistic religion, and the saints and
      martyrs form in it practically a secondary or minor rank of deities.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the point of view of the god-slayers cannot be more
      graphically put than in the story which Mr. William Simpson relates of Sir
      Richard Burton. Burton, it seems, was exploring a remote Mahommedan region
      on the Indian frontier, and in order to do so with greater freedom and
      ease had disguised himself as a fakir of Islam. So great was his knowledge
      of Muslim devotions that the people soon began to entertain a great
      respect for him as a most holy person. He was congratulating himself upon
      the success of his disguise, and looking forward to a considerable stay in
      the valley, when one night one of the elders of the village came to him
      stealthily, and begged him, if he valued his own safety, to go away.
      Burton asked whether the people did not like him. The elder answered, yes;
      that was the root of the trouble. They had conceived, in fact, the highest
      possible opinion of his exceptional sanctity, and they thought it would be
      an excellent thing for the village to possess the tomb of so holy a man.
      So they were casting about now how they could best kill him. Whether this
      particular story is true or not, it at least exhibits in very vivid
      colours the state of mind of the ordinary god-slayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Tylor, Mr. Speth, and other writers on foundation sacrifices treat
      them as springing from primitive animism. To me, they seem rather to imply
      the exact opposite. For if everything has already a soul by nature, why
      kill a man or criminal to supply it with one?

      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;GODS OF CULTIVATION.

      interesting in the curious group of artifically-made gods are those which
      are sacrificed in connexion with agriculture. These deities appeal to us
      from several points of view. In the first place, they form, among
      agricultural races as a whole, the most important and venerated objects of
      worship. In the second place, it is largely through their influence or on
      their analogy, as I believe, that so many other artificial gods came to be
      renewed or sacrificed annually. In the third place, it is the gods of
      agriculture who are most of all slain sacramentally, whose bodies are
      eaten by their votaries in the shape of cakes of bread or other
      foodstuffs, and whose blood is drunk in the form of wine. <i>The immediate
      connexion of these sacramental ceremonies with the sacrifice of the mass,
      and the identification of the Christ with bread and wine, give to this
      branch of our enquiry a peculiar importance from the point of view of the
      evolution of Christianity</i>. We must therefore enter at some little
      length into the genesis of these peculiar and departmental gods, who stand
      so directly in the main line of evolution of the central divine figure in
      the Christian religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All over the world, wherever cultivation exists, a special class of
      corn-gods or grain-gods is found, deities of the chief foodstuff,&mdash;be
      it maize, or dates, or plantain, or rice&mdash;and it is a common feature
      of all these gods that they are represented by human or quasi-human
      victims, who are annually slain at the time of sowing. These human gods
      <span class="pagenum">273</span><a name="link273" id="link273"></a>are
      believed to reappear once more in the form of the crop that rises from
      their sacred bodies; their death and resurrection are celebrated in
      festivals; and they are eaten and drunk sacramentally by their votaries,
      in the shape of first-fruits, or of cakes and wine, or of some other
      embodiment of the divine being. We have therefore to enquire into the
      origin of this curious superstition, which involves, as it seems to me,
      the very origin of cultivation itself as a human custom. And I must
      accordingly bespeak my readers&rsquo; indulgence if I diverge for a while
      into what may seem at first a purely botanical digression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people must have been struck by the paradox of cultivation. A
      particular plant in a state of nature, let us say, grows and thrives only
      in water, or in some exceedingly moist and damp situation. You take up
      this waterside plant with a trowel one day, and transfer it incontinently
      to a dry bed in a sun-baked garden; when lo! the moisture-loving creature,
      instead of withering and dying, as one might naturally expect of it,
      begins to grow apace, and to thrive to all appearance even better and more
      lustily than in its native habitat. Or you remove some parched desert weed
      from its arid rock to a moist and rainy climate; and instead of dwindling,
      as one imagines it ought to do under the altered conditions, it spreads
      abroad in the deep rich mould of a shrubbery bed, and attains a stature
      impossible to its kind in its original surroundings. Our gardens, in fact,
      show us side by side plants which, in the wild state, demand the most
      varied and dissimilar habitats. Siberian squills blossom amicably in the
      same bed with Italian tulips; the alpine saxifrage spreads its purple
      rosettes in friendly rivalry with the bog-loving marsh-marigold or the dry
      Spanish iris. The question, therefore, sooner or later occurs to the
      enquiring mind: How can they all live together so well here in man&rsquo;s
      domain, when in the outside world each demands and exacts so extremely
      different and specialised a situation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of <span class="pagenum">274</span><a name="link274" id="link274"></a>course
      it is only an inexperienced biologist who could long be puzzled by this
      apparent paradox. He must soon see the true solution of the riddle, if he
      has read and digested the teachings of Darwin. For the real fact is, in a
      garden or out of it, most of these plants could get on very well in a
      great variety of climates or situations&mdash;if only they were protected
      against outside competition. There we have the actual crux of the problem.
      It is not that the moisture-loving plants cannot live in dry situations,
      but that the dry-loving plants, specialised and adapted for the post, can
      compete with them there at an immense advantage, and so, in a very short
      time, live them down altogether. Every species in a state of nature is
      continually exposed to the ceaseless competition of every other; and each
      on its own ground can beat its competitors. But in a garden, the very
      thing we aim at is just to restrict and prevent competition; to give each
      species a fair chance for life, even in conditions where other and
      better-adapted species can usually outlive it. This, in fact, is really at
      bottom all that we ever mean by a garden&mdash;a space of ground cleared,
      and kept clear, of its natural vegetation (commonly called in this
      connexion weeds), and deliberately stocked with other plants, most or all
      of which the weeds would live down if not artificially prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see the truth of this point of view the moment the garden is, as we
      say, abandoned&mdash;that is to say, left once more to the operation of
      unaided nature. The plants with which we have stocked it loiter on for a
      while in a feeble and uncertain fashion, but are ultimately choked out by
      the stronger and better-adapted weeds which compose the natural vegetation
      of the locality. The dock and nettle live down in time the larkspur and
      the peony. The essential thing in the garden is, in short, the clearing of
      the ground from the weeds&mdash;that is, in other words, from the native
      vegetation. A few minor things may or may not be added, such as manuring,
      turning the soil, protecting with <span class="pagenum">275</span><a
      name="link275" id="link275"></a>shelter, and so forth; but the clearing is
      itself the one thing needful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slight as this point seems at first sight, I believe it includes the whole
      secret of the origin of tillage, and therefore, by implication, of the
      gods of agriculture. For, looked at in essence, cultivation is weeding,
      and weeding is cultivation. When we say that a certain race cultivates a
      certain plant-staple, we mean no more in the last resort than that it sows
      or sets it in soil artificially cleared of competing species. Sowing
      without clearing is absolutely useless. So the question of the origin of
      cultivation resolves itself at last simply into this&mdash;how did certain
      men come first to know that by clearing ground of weeds and keeping it
      clear of them they could promote the growth of certain desirable human
      foodstuffs?
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, it may be as well to premise that the problem of the origin
      of cultivation is a far more complex one than appears at first sight. For
      we have not only to ask, as might seem to the enquirer unaccustomed to
      such investigations, &ldquo;How did the early savage first find out that
      seeds would grow better when planted in open soil, already freed from
      weeds or natural competitors?&rdquo; but also the other and far more
      difficult question, &ldquo;How did the early savage ever find out that
      plants would grow from seeds at all?&rdquo; That, I take it, is the real
      riddle of the situation, and it is one which, so far as I know, has
      hitherto escaped all enquirers into the history and origin of human
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fully to grasp the profound nature of this difficulty we must throw
      ourselves back mentally into the condition and position of primitive man.
      We ourselves have known so long and so familiarly the fact that plants
      grow from seeds&mdash;that the seed is the essential reproductive part of
      the vegetable organism&mdash;that we find it hard to unthink that piece of
      commonplace knowledge, and to realise that what to us is an almost
      self-evident truth is to the primitive savage a long and difficult
      inference. Our own common and <span class="pagenum">276</span><a
      name="link276" id="link276"></a>certain acquaintance with the fact,
      indeed, is entirely-derived from the practice of agriculture. We have seen
      seeds sown from our earliest childhood. But before agriculture grew up,
      the connexion between seed and seedling could not possibly be known or
      even suspected by primitive man, who was by no means prone to make
      abstract investigations into the botanical nature or physiological object
      of the various organs in the herbs about him. That the seed is the
      reproductive part of the plant was a fact as little likely in itself to
      strike him as that the stamens were the male organs, or that the leaves
      were the assimilative and digestive surfaces. He could only have found out
      that plants grew from seeds by the experimental process of sowing and
      growing them. Such an experiment he was far from likely ever to try for
      its own sake. He must have been led to it by some other and accidental
      coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what was primitive man likely to know and observe about the plants
      around him? Primarily one thing only: that some of them were edible, and
      some were not. There you have a distinction of immediate interest to all
      humanity. And what parts of plants were most likely to be useful to him in
      this respect as foodstuffs? Those parts which the plant had specially
      filled up with rich material for its own use or the use of its offspring.
      The first are the roots, stocks, bulbs, corms, or tubers in which it lays
      by foodstuffs for its future growth; the second are the seeds which it
      produces and enriches in order to continue its kind to succeeding
      generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Primitive man, then, knows the fruits, seeds, and tubers, just as the
      squirrel, the monkey, and the parrot know them, as so much good foodstuff,
      suitable to his purpose. But why should he ever dream of saving or
      preserving some of these fruits or seeds, when he has found them, and of
      burying them in the soil, on the bare off-chance that by pure magic, as it
      were, they might give rise to others? No idea could be more foreign to the
      nature and <span class="pagenum">277</span><a name="link277" id="link277"></a>habits
      of early man. In the first place, he is far from provident; his way is to
      eat up at once what he has killed or picked; and in the second place, how
      could he ever come to conceive that seeds buried in the ground could
      possibly produce more seeds in future? Nay, even if he did know it&mdash;which
      is well-nigh impossible&mdash;would he be likely, feckless creature that
      he is, to save or spare a handful of seeds to-day in order that other
      seeds might spring from their burial-place in another twelvemonth? The
      difficulty is so enormous when one fairly faces it that it positively
      staggers one; we begin to wonder whether really, after all, the first
      steps in cultivation&rsquo; could ever have been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The savage, when he has killed a deer or a game-bird, does not bury a part
      of it or an egg of it in the ground, in the expectation that it will grow
      into more deer or more bird hereafter. Why, then, should he, when he has
      picked a peck of fruits or wild cereals, bury some of them in the ground,
      and expect a harvest? The savage is a simple and superstitious person; but
      I do not think he is quite such a fool as this proceeding would make him
      out to be. He is not likely ever to have noticed that plants in the wild
      state grow from seeds&mdash;at least prior to the rise of agriculture,
      from which, as I believe, he first and slowly gained that useful
      knowledge. And he certainly is not likely ever to have tried deliberate
      experiments upon the properties of plants, as if he were a Fellow of the
      Royal Society. These two roads being thus effectually blocked to us, we
      have to enquire, &ldquo;Was there ever any way in which primitive man
      could have blundered blindfold upon a knowledge of the truth, and could
      have discovered incidentally to some other function of his life the two
      essential facts that plants grow from seeds, and that the growth and
      supply of useful food-plants can be artificially increased by burying or
      sowing such seeds in ground cleared of weeds, that is to say of the
      natural competing vegetation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I <span class="pagenum">278</span><a name="link278" id="link278"></a>believe
      there is one way, and one way only, in which primitive man was at all
      likely to become familiar with these facts. I shall try to show that all
      the operations of primitive agriculture very forcibly point to this
      strange and almost magical origin of cultivation; that all savage
      agriculture retains to the last many traces of its origin; and that the
      sowing of the seed itself is hardly considered so important and essential
      a part of the complex process as certain purely superstitious and
      bloodthirsty practices that long accompany it. In one word, not to keep
      the reader in doubt any longer, I am inclined to believe that cultivation
      and the sowing of seeds for crops had their beginning as an adjunct of the
      primitive burial system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the present time, so far as I know, only one origin for cultivation
      has ever been even conjecturally suggested; and that is a hard one. It has
      been said that the first hint of cultivation may have come from the
      observation that seeds accidentally cast out on the kitchen-middens, or on
      the cleared space about huts, caves, or other human dwelling-places,
      germinated and produced more seeds in succeeding seasons. Very probably
      many savages have observed the fact that food-plants frequently grow on
      such heaps of refuse. But that observation alone does not bring us much
      nearer to the origin of cultivation. For why should early man connect such
      a fact with the seeds more than with the bones, the shells, or the mere
      accident of proximity? We must rid our minds of all the preconceptions of
      inductive and experimental science, and throw ourselves mentally back into
      the position of the savage to whom nature is one vast field of unrelated
      events, without fixed sequence or physical causation. Moreover, a
      kitchen-midden is not a cleared space: on the contrary, it is a weed-bed
      of extraordinary luxuriance. It brings us no nearer the origin of
      clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, one set of functions in which primitive men do actually
      perform all the essential acts of agriculture, without in the least
      intending it; and that is the almost <span class="pagenum">279</span><a
      name="link279" id="link279"></a>universal act of the burial of the dead.
      Burial is, so far as I can see, the only object for which early races, or,
      what comes to the same thing, very low savages, ever turn or dig the
      ground. We have seen already that the original idea of burial was to
      confine the ghost or corpse of the dead man by putting a weight of earth
      on top of him; and lest this should be insufficient to keep him from
      troublesome reappearances, a big stone was frequently rolled above his
      mound or tumulus, which is the origin of all our monuments, now diverted
      to the honour and commemoration of the deceased. But the point to which I
      wish just now to direct attention is this&mdash;that in the act of burial,
      and in that act alone, we get a first beginning of turning the soil,
      exposing fresh earth, and so incidentally eradicating the weeds. We have
      here, in short, the first necessary prelude to the evolution of
      agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step, of course, must be the sowing of the seed. And here, I
      venture to think, funeral customs supply us with the only conceivable way
      in which such sowing could ever have begun. For early men would certainly
      not waste the precious seeds which it took them so much time and trouble
      to collect from the wild plants around them, in mere otiose scientific
      experiments on vegetable development. But we have seen that it is the
      custom of all savages to offer at the tombs of their ancestors food and
      drink of the same kind as they themselves are in the habit of using. Now,
      with people in the hunting stage, such offerings would no doubt most
      frequently consist of meat, the flesh of the hunted beasts or game-birds;
      but they would also include fish, fruits, seeds, tubers, and berries, and
      in particular such rich grains as those of the native pulses and cereals.
      Evidence of such things being offered at the graves of the dead has been
      collected in such abundance by Dr. Tylor, Mr. Frazer, and Mr. Herbert
      Spencer, that I need not here adduce any further examples of so familiar a
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      What must be the obvious result? Here, and here alone, <span
      class="pagenum">280</span><a name="link280" id="link280"></a>the savage
      quite unconsciously sows seeds upon newly-turned ground, deprived of its
      weeds, and further manured by the blood and meat of the frequent
      sacrificial offerings. These seeds must often spring up and grow apace,
      with a rapidity and luxuriance which cannot fail to strike the imagination
      of the primitive hunter. Especially will this be the case with that class
      of plants which ultimately develop into the food-crops of civilised
      society. For the peculiarity of these plants is that they are one and all&mdash;maize,
      corn, or rice, pease, beans, or millet&mdash;annuals of rapid growth and
      portentous stature; plants which have thriven in the struggle for
      existence by laying up large stores of utilisable material in their seeds
      for the use of the seedling; and this peculiarity enables them to start in
      life in each generation exceptionally well endowed, and so to compete at
      an advantage with all their fellows. Seeds of such a sort would thrive
      exceedingly in the newly-turned and well-manured soil of a grave or
      barrow; and producing there a quantity of rich and edible grain, would
      certainly attract the attention of that practical and observant man, the
      savage. For though he is so incurious about what are non-essentials, your
      savage is a peculiarly longheaded person about all that concerns his own
      immediate advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      What conclusion would at once be forced upon him? That seeds planted in
      freshly-turned and richly-manured soil produce threefold and fourfold?
      Nothing of the sort. He knows naught of seeds and manures and soils; he
      would at once conclude, after his kind, that the dreaded and powerful
      ghost in the barrow, pleased with the gifts of meat and seeds offered to
      him, had repaid those gifts in kind by returning grain for grain a
      hundredfold out of his own body. This original connexion of ideas seems to
      me fully to explain that curious identification of the ghost or spirit
      with the corn or other foodstuff which Mr. Frazer has so wonderfully and
      conclusively elaborated in <i>The Golden Bough</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some <span class="pagenum">281</span><a name="link281" id="link281"></a>little
      evidence is even forthcoming that vegetation actually <i>does</i> show
      exceptional luxuriance on graves and barrows. The Rev. Alexander Stewart
      of Ballachulish mentions that the milkmaids in Lochaber and elsewhere in
      the Scotch highlands used to pour a little milk daily from the pail on the
      &ldquo;fairy knowes,&rdquo; or prehistoric barrows; and the consequence
      was that &ldquo;these fairy knolls were clothed with a more beautiful
      verdure than any other spot in the country.&rdquo; In Fiji, Mr. Fison
      remarks that yam-plants spring luxuriantly from the heaps of yam presented
      to ancestral spirits in the sacred stone enclosure or <i>temenos</i>; and
      two or three recent correspondents (since this chapter was first printed
      in a monthly review) have obligingly communicated to me analogous facts
      from Madagascar, Central Africa, and the Malay Archipelago. It is clear
      from their accounts that graves do often give rise to crops of foodstuffs,
      accidentally springing from the food laid upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at first, under such circumstances, the savage would no doubt be
      content merely to pick and eat the seeds that thus grew casually, as it
      were, on the graves or barrows of his kings and kinsfolk. But in process
      of time it would almost certainly come about that the area of cultivation
      would be widened somewhat. The first step toward such widening, I take it,
      would arise from the observation that cereals and other seeds only throve
      exceptionally upon newly-made graves, not on graves in general. For as
      soon as the natural vegetation reasserted itself, the quickening power of
      the ghost would seem to be used up. Thus it might be found well to keep
      fresh ghosts always going for agricultural purposes. Hence might gradually
      arise a habit of making a new grave annually, at the most favourable
      sowing-time, which last would come to be recognised by half-unconscious
      experiment and observation. And this new grave, as I shall show reason for
      believing a little later, would be the grave, not of a person who happened
      to die then and there accidentally, but <span class="pagenum">282</span><a
      name="link282" id="link282"></a>of a deliberate victim, slain in order to
      provide a spirit of vegetation,&mdash;an artificial god,&mdash;and to make
      the corn grow with vigour and luxuriance. Step by step, I believe, it
      would at length be discovered that if only you dug wide enough, the corn
      would grow well <i>around</i> as well as <i>upon</i> the actual grave of
      the divine victim. Thus slowly there would develop the cultivated field,
      the wider clearing, dug up or laboured by hand, and finally the ploughed
      field, which yet remains a grave in theory and in all essentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have ventured to give this long and apparently unessential preamble,
      because I wish to make it clear that the manufactured or artificial god of
      the corn-field or other cultivated plot really dates back to the very
      origin of cultivation. Without a god, there would be no corn-field at all;
      and the corn-field, I believe, is long conceived merely as the embodiment
      of his vegetative spirit. Nay, the tilled field is often at our own day,
      and even in our own country, a grave in theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a mere commonplace at the present time to say that among early men
      and savages every act of life has a sacred significance; and agriculture
      especially is everywhere and always invested with a special sanctity. To
      us, it would seem natural that the act of sowing seed should be regarded
      as purely practical and physiological; that the seed should be looked upon
      merely as the part of the plant intended for reproduction, and that its
      germination should be accepted as a natural and normal process. Savages
      and early men, however, have no such conceptions. To them the whole thing
      is a piece of natural magic; you sow seeds, or, to be more accurate, you
      bury certain grains of foodstuff in the freshly-turned soil, with certain
      magical rites and ceremonies; and then, after the lapse of a certain time,
      plants begin to grow upon this soil, from which you finally obtain a crop
      of maize or wheat or barley. The burial of the seeds or grains is only one
      part of the <span class="pagenum">283</span><a name="link283" id="link283"></a>magical
      cycle, no more necessarily important for the realisation of the desired
      end than many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what are the other magical acts necessary in order that grain-bearing
      plants may grow upon the soil prepared for their reception? Mr. Frazer has
      collected abundant evidence for answering that question, a small part of
      which I shall recapitulate here for the benefit of those who have not read
      his remarkable work, referring students to The Golden Bough itself for
      fuller details and collateral developments. At the same time I should like
      to make it clearly understood that Mr. Frazer is personally in no way
      responsible for the use I here make of his admirable materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the world over, savages and semi-civilised people are in the habit of
      sacrificing human victims, whose bodies are buried in the field with the
      seed of corn or other bread-stuffs. Often enough the victim&rsquo;s blood
      is mixed with the grain in order to fertilise it. The most famous instance
      is that of the Khonds of Orissa, who chose special victims, known as
      Meriahs, and offered them up to ensure good harvests. The Meriah was often
      kept for years before being sacrificed. He was regarded as a consecrated
      being, and treated with extreme affection, mingled with deference. A
      Meriah youth, on reaching manhood, was given a wife who was herself a
      Meriah; their offspring were all brought up as victims. &ldquo;The
      periodical sacrifices,&rdquo; says Mr. Frazer, &ldquo;were generally so
      arranged by tribes and divisions of tribes that each head of a family was
      enabled, at least once a year, to procure a shred of flesh for his fields,
      generally about the time when his chief crop was laid down.&rdquo; On the
      day of the sacrifice, which was horrible beyond description in its
      details, the body was cut to pieces, and the flesh hacked from it was
      instantly taken home by the persons whom each village had deputed to bring
      it. On arriving at its destination, it was divided by the priest into two
      portions, one of which he buried in a hole in the ground, with his back
      turned and without looking <span class="pagenum">284</span><a
      name="link284" id="link284"></a>at it. Then each man in the village added
      a little earth to cover it, and the priest poured water over the mimic
      tumulus. The other portion of the flesh the priest divided into as many
      shares as there were heads of houses present. Each head of a house buried
      his shred in his own field, placing it in the earth behind his back
      without looking. The other remains of the human victim&mdash;the head, the
      bones, and the intestines&mdash;were burned on a funeral-pile, and the
      ashes were scattered over the fields, or mixed with the new corn to
      preserve it from injury. Every one of these details should be carefully
      noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in this case, it is quite clear to me that every field is regarded as
      essentially a grave; portions of the divine victim are buried in it; his
      ashes are mixed with the seed; and from the ground thus treated he springs
      again in the form of corn, or rice, or turmeric. These customs, as Mr.
      Frazer rightly notes, &ldquo;imply that to the body of the Meriah there
      was ascribed a direct or intrinsic power of making the crops to grow. In
      other words, the flesh and ashes of the victim were believed to be endowed
      with a magical or physical power of fertilising the land.&rdquo; More than
      that, it seems to me that the seed itself is not regarded as sufficient to
      produce a crop: it is the seed buried in the sacred grave with the divine
      flesh which germinates at last into next year&rsquo;s foodstuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few other points must be noticed about this essential case, which is one
      of the most typical instances of manufactured godhead. The Meriah was only
      satisfactory if he had been purchased&mdash;&ldquo;bought with a price,&rdquo;
      like the children who were built as foundation-gods into walls; or else
      was the child of a previous Meriah&mdash;in other words, was of divine
      stock by descent and inheritance. Khonds in distress often sold their
      children as Meriahs, &ldquo;considering the beatification&rdquo;
      (apotheosis, I would rather say) &ldquo;of their souls certain, and <i>their
      death, for the benefit of mankind, the most honourable possible</i>.&rdquo;
      This sense of the sacrifice as a case of &ldquo;one man dying for the
      people&rdquo; is most <span class="pagenum">285</span><a name="link285"
      id="link285"></a>marked in our accounts, and is especially interesting
      from its analogy to Christian reasoning. A man of the Panua tribe was once
      known to upbraid a Khond because he had sold for a Meriah his daughter
      whom the Panuâ wished to marry; the Khonds around at once comforted the
      insulted father, exclaiming, &ldquo;Your child died that all the world may
      live.&rdquo; Here and elsewhere we have the additional idea of a piacular
      value attached to the sacrifice, about which more must be said in a
      subsequent chapter. The death of the Meriah was supposed to ensure not
      only good crops, but also &ldquo;immunity from all disease and accident.&rdquo;
      The Khonds shouted in his dying ear, &ldquo;We bought you with a price; no
      sin rests with us.&rdquo; It is also worthy of notice that the victim was
      anointed with oil, a point which recalls the very name of Christus. Once
      more, the victim might not be bound or make any show of resistance; but
      the bones of his arms and his legs were often broken to render struggling
      impossible. Sometimes, however, he was stupefied with opium, one of the
      ordinary features in the manufacture of gods, as we have already seen,
      being such preliminary stupefaction. Among the various ways in which the
      Meriah was slain I would particularly specify the mode of execution by
      squeezing him to death in the cleft of a tree. I mention these points
      here, though they somewhat interrupt the general course of our argument,
      because of their great importance as antecedents of the Christian theory.
      In fact, <i>I believe the Christian legend to have been mainly constructed
      out of the details of such early god-making sacrifices; I hold that Christ
      is essentially one such artificial god; and I trust the reader will
      carefully observe for himself as we proceed how many small details (such
      as the breaking of the bones) recall in many ways the incidents of the
      passion and the crucifixion</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Khonds, however, have somewhat etherealised the conception of
      artificial god-making by allowing one victim to do for many fields
      together. Other savages are more prodigal <span class="pagenum">286</span><a
      name="link286" id="link286"></a>of divine crop-raisers. To draw once more
      from Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s storehouse&mdash;the Indians of Guayaquil, in
      South America, used to sacrifice human blood and the hearts of men when
      they sowed their fields. The ancient Mexicans, conceiving the maize as a
      personal being who went through the whole course of life between seed-time
      and harvest, sacrificed new-born babes when the maize was sown, older
      children when it had sprouted, and so on till it was fully ripe, when they
      sacrificed old men. May we not parallel with this instance the singular
      fact that the Romans had as their chief agricultural deity Saturnus, the
      god of sowing, but had also several other subsidiary crop-deities, such as
      Seia, who has to do with the corn when it sprouts, Segetia, with the corn
      when shot up, and Tutilina with the corn stored in the granary? (An
      obvious objection based on the numerous gods of childhood and practical
      arts at Rome will be answered in a later chapter.) The Pawnees, again,
      annually sacrificed a human victim in spring, when they sowed their
      fields. They thought that an omission of this sacrifice would be followed
      by the total failure of the crops of maize, beans, and pumpkins. In the
      account of one such sacrifice of a girl in 1837 or 1838, we are told:
      &ldquo;While her flesh was still warm, it was cut in small pieces from the
      bones, put in little baskets, and taken to a neighbouring corn-field. Here
      the head chief took a piece of the flesh from a basket, and squeezed a
      drop of blood upon the newly-deposited grains of corn. His example was
      followed by the rest, till all the seed had been sprinkled with the blood;
      it was then covered up with earth.&rdquo; Many other cases might be quoted
      from America.
    </p>
    <p>
      In West Africa, once more, a tribal queen used to sacrifice a man and
      woman in the month of March. They were killed with spades and hoes, and
      their bodies buried in the middle of a field which had just been tilled.
      At Lagos, in Guinea, it was the custom annually to impale a young girl
      alive soon after the spring equinox in order to <span class="pagenum">287</span><a
      name="link287" id="link287"></a>secure good crops. A similar sacrifice is
      still annually offered at Benin. The Marimos, a Bechuana tribe, sacrifice
      a human being for the crops. The victim chosen is generally a short stout
      man. He is seized by violence or intoxicated (note that detail) and taken
      to the fields, where he is killed amongst the wheat &ldquo;to serve as
      seed.&rdquo; After his blood has coagulated in the sun, it is burned,
      along with that peculiarly sacred part, the frontal bone, the flesh
      attached to it, and the brain; the ashes are then scattered over the
      ground to fertilise it. Such scattering of the ashes occurs in many
      instances, and will meet us again in the case of Osiris.
    </p>
    <p>
      In India, once more, the Gonds, like the Khonds, kidnapped Brahman boys,
      and kept them as victims to be sacrificed on various occasions. At sowing
      and reaping, after a triumphal procession, one of the lads was killed by
      being punctured with a poisoned arrow. His blood was then sprinkled over
      the ploughed field or the ripe crop, and his flesh was sacramentally
      devoured. The last point again will call at a later stage for further
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will detail no more such instances (out of the thousands that exist) for
      fear of seeming tedious. But the interpretation I put upon the facts is
      this. Originally, men noticed that food-plants grew abundantly from the
      laboured and well-manured soil of graves. They observed that this richness
      sprang from a coincidence of three factors&mdash;digging, a sacred dead
      body, and seeds of foodstuffs. In time, they noted that if you dug wide
      enough and scattered seed far enough, a single corpse was capable of
      fertilising a considerable area. The grave grew into the field or garden.
      But they still thought it necessary to bury some one in the field; and
      most of the evidence shows that they regarded this victim as a divine
      personage; that they considered him the main source of growth or
      fertility; and that they endeavoured to deserve his favour by treating him
      well during the greater part of his lifetime. For in many of the accounts
      it is expressly stated <span class="pagenum">288</span><a name="link288"
      id="link288"></a>that the intended victim was treated as a god or as a
      divine king, and was supplied with every sort of luxury up to the moment
      of his immolation. In process of time, the conception of the field as
      differing from the grave grew more defined, and the large part borne by
      seed in the procedure was more fully recognised. Even so, however, nobody
      dreamed of sowing the seed alone without the body of a victim. Both grain
      and flesh or blood came to be regarded alike as &ldquo;seed&rdquo;: that
      is to say, the concurrence of the two was considered necessary to produce
      the desired effect of germination and fertility. Till a very late period,
      either the actual sacrifice or some vague remnant of it remained as an
      essential part of cultivation. Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s pages teem with such
      survivals in modern folk-custom. From his work and from other sources, I
      will give a few instances of these last dying relics of the primitive
      superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gomme, in his <i>Ethnology in Folklore</i>, supplies an account of a
      singular village festival in Southern India. In this feast, a priest,
      known as the Potraj, and specially armed with a divine whip, like the
      scourge of Osiris, sacrifices a sacred buffalo, which is turned loose when
      a calf, and allowed to feed and roam about the village. In that case, we
      have the common substitution of an animal for a human victim, which almost
      always accompanies advancing civilisation. At the high festival, the head
      of the buffalo was struck off at a single blow, and placed in front of the
      shrine of the village goddess. Around were placed vessels containing the
      different cereals, and hard by a heap of mixed grains with a drill-plough
      in the centre. The carcase was then cut up into small pieces, and each
      cultivator received a portion to bury in his field. The heap of grain was
      finally divided among all the cultivators, to be buried by each one in his
      field with the bit of flesh. At last, the head, that very sacred part, was
      buried before a little temple, sacred to the goddess of boundaries. The
      goddess is represented by a shapeless stone&mdash;no doubt a Terminus,
      <span class="pagenum">289</span><a name="link289" id="link289"></a>or
      rather the tombstone of an artificial goddess, a girl buried under an
      ancient boundary-mark. Here we have evidently a last stage of the same
      ritual which in the case of the Khonds was performed with a human victim.
      It is worth while noting that, as part of this ceremony, a struggle took
      place for portions of the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      A still more attenuated form of the same ceremony is mentioned by Captain
      Harkness and others, as occurring among the Badagas of the Nilgiri Hills.
      I condense their accounts, taking out of each such elements as are most
      cognate to our purpose. Among these barbarians, the first furrow is
      ploughed by a low-caste Kurrumbar, who gives his benediction to the field,
      without which there would be no harvest. Here, the member of the
      aboriginal race is clearly looked upon as a priest or kinsman of the local
      gods, whose cooperation must be obtained by later intrusive races. But the
      Kurrumbar does not merely bless the field; he also sets up a stone in its
      midst; and then, prostrating himself before the stone, he sacrifices a
      goat, the head of which he keeps as his perquisite. This peculiar value of
      the oracular head retained by the priest is also significant. When
      harvest-time comes, the same Kurrumbar is summoned once more, in order
      that he may reap the first handful of corn, an episode the full importance
      of which will only be apparent to those who have read Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s
      analysis of harvest customs. But in this case also, the appearance of the
      sacred stone is pregnant with meaning. We can hardly resist the inference
      that we have here to do with the animal substitute for a human sacrifice
      of the god-making order, in which the victim was slaughtered, a stone set
      up to mark the site of the sacrifice, and the head preserved as a god to
      give oracles, in the fashion with which we are already familiar. Comparing
      this instance with the previous one of the sacred buffalo and the still
      earlier cases of ancestral heads preserved as gods for oracular purposes,
      I think the affiliation is too clear to be disregarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidence <span class="pagenum">290</span><a name="link290" id="link290"></a>of
      similar customs elsewhere exists in such abundance that I can only give a
      very small part of it at present, lest I should assign too much space to a
      subordinate question; I hope to detail the whole of it hereafter in a
      subsequent volume. Here is a striking example from Mr. Gomme&rsquo;s <i>Ethnology
      in Folklore</i>, the analogy of which with preceding instances will at
      once be apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the village of Holne, situated on one of the spurs of Dartmoor,
      is a field of about two acres, the property of the parish, and called the
      Ploy Field. In the centre of this field stands a granite pillar (Menhir)
      six or seven feet high. On May-morning, before daybreak, the young men of
      the village used to assemble there, and then proceed to the moor, where
      they selected a ram lamb, and, after running it down, brought it in
      triumph to the Ploy Field, fastened it to the pillar, cut its throat, and
      then roasted it whole, skin, wool, etc. At midday a struggle took place,
      at the risk of cut hands, for a slice, it being supposed to confer luck
      for the ensuing year on the fortunate devourer. As an act of gallantry the
      young men sometimes fought their way through the crowd to get a slice for
      the chosen amongst the young women, all of whom, in their best dresses,
      attended the Ram Feast, as it was called. Dancing, wrestling, and other
      games, assisted by copious libations of cider during the afternoon,
      prolonged the festivity till midnight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here again we get several interesting features of the primitive ritual
      preserved for us. The connexion with the stone which enshrines the
      original village deity is perfectly clear. This stone no doubt represents
      the place where the local foundation-god was slain in very remote ages;
      and it is therefore the proper place for the annual renewal sacrifices to
      be offered. The selection of Maymorning for the rite; the slaughter at the
      stone pillar; the roasting of the beast whole; the struggle for the
      pieces; and the idea that they would confer luck, all show survival of
      primitive feeling. So does the cider, sacramental <span class="pagenum">291</span><a
      name="link291" id="link291"></a>intoxication being an integral part of all
      these proceedings. Every detail, indeed, has its meaning for those who
      look close; for the struggle at midday is itself significant, as is also
      the prolongation of the feast till midnight. But we miss the burial of the
      pieces in the fields; in so far, the primitive object of the rite seems to
      have been forgotten or overlooked in Devonshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A still more attenuated survival is quoted by Mr. Gomme from another
      English village. &ldquo;A Whitsuntide custom in the parish of King&rsquo;s
      Teignton, Devonshire, is thus described: A lamb is drawn about the parish
      on Whitsun Monday in a cart covered with garlands of lilac, laburnum, and
      other flowers, when persons are requested to give something towards the
      animal and attendant expenses; on Tuesday it is killed and roasted whole
      in the middle of the village. The lamb is then sold in slices to the poor
      at a cheap rate. The origin of the custom is forgotten, but a tradition,
      supposed to trace back to heathen days, is to this effect: The village
      suffered from a dearth of water, when the inhabitants were advised by
      their priests to pray to the gods for water; whereupon the water sprang up
      spontaneously in a meadow about a third of a mile above the river, in an
      estate now called Rydon, amply sufficient to supply the wants of the
      place, and at present adequate, even in a dry summer, to work three mills.
      A lamb, it is said, has ever since that time been sacrificed as a votive
      thank-offering at Whitsuntide in the manner before mentioned. The said
      water appears like a large pond, from which in rainy weather may be seen
      jets springing up some inches above the surface in many parts. It has ever
      had the name of &lsquo;Fair Water.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I mention this curious instance here, because it well illustrates the
      elusive way in which such divine customs of various origins merge into one
      another; and also the manner in which different ideas are attached in
      different places to very similar ceremonies. For Mr. Frazer has shown that
      the notion of a rain-charm is also closely bound up with <span
      class="pagenum">292</span><a name="link292" id="link292"></a>the gods of
      agriculture; the Khond Meriah must weep, or there will be no rain that
      year; his red blood must flow, or the turmeric will not produce its proper
      red colour. (Compare the red blood that flowed from Poly-dorus&rsquo;s
      cornel, and the Indian&rsquo;s blood that drops from the Canadian
      bloodroot.) In this last instance of the King&rsquo;s Teignton ceremony,
      it is the rain-charm that has most clearly survived to our days: and there
      are obvious references to a human sacrifice offered up to make a river-god
      in times long gone, and now replaced by an animal victim. The garlands of
      lilac, laburnum, and other flowers are, however, common adornments of the
      artificial god of cultivation; they occurred in the Dionvsiac rites and
      the Attis festival, and are still preserved in many European customs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very closely bound up with the artificial gods of cultivation are the
      terminal gods with whom I dealt in the last chapter; so closely that it is
      sometimes impossible to separate them. We have already seen some instances
      of this connexion; the procession of the sacred victim usually ends with a
      perlustration of the boundaries. This perlustration is often preceded by
      the head of the thean-thropic victim. Such a ceremony extends all over
      India; in France and other European countries it survives in the shape of
      the rite known as Blessing the Fields, where the priest plays the same
      part as is played among the Nilgiri hillsmen by the low-caste Kurrumbar.
      In this rite, the Host is carried round the bounds of the parish, as the
      head of the sacred buffalo is carried round at the Indian festival. In
      some cases every field is separately visited. I was told as a boy in
      Normandy that a portion of the Host (stolen or concealed, I imagine) was
      sometimes buried in each field, but of this curious detail I can now
      obtain no confirmatory evidence, and I do not insist upon it. <i>We must
      remember, however, that the Host is the body of Christ, and that its
      presence in such cases is the exact analogue of the carrying round the
      pieces of the Meriah</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <span class="pagenum">293</span><a name="link293" id="link293"></a>England,
      the ceremony merges into that of Beating the Bounds, already described;
      though I believe the significance of the boy-victims, and the necessity
      for whipping them as a rain-charm, will now be more apparent than when we
      last met with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many cases, all the world over, various animals come to replace the
      human victim-god. Thus we learn from Festus that the Romans sacrificed
      red-haired puppies in spring, in the belief that the crops would thus grow
      ripe and ruddy; and there can be little doubt that these puppies, like the
      lamb sacrifice at Holne and King&rsquo;s Teignton, were a substitute for
      an original human victim. Even so, the Egyptians, as we shall see,
      sacrificed red-haired men as the representatives of Osiris, envisaged as a
      corn-god. In some cases, indeed, we have historical evidence of the human
      god being replaced at recent dates by a divine animal-victim; for example,
      in Chinna Kimedy, after the British had suppressed human sacrifices, a
      goat took the place of the sacred Meriah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mannhardt has collected much evidence of the curious customs still (or
      lately) existing in modern Europe, which look like survivals in a very
      mitigated form of the same superstition. These are generally known by the
      name of &ldquo;Carrying out Death,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Burying the Carnival.&rdquo;
      They are practised in almost every country of Europe, and relics of them
      survive even in England. The essence of these ceremonies consists in an
      effigy being substituted for the human victim. This effigy is treated much
      as the victim used to be. Sometimes it is burned, sometimes thrown into a
      river, and sometimes buried piecemeal. In Austrian Silesia, for example,
      the effigy is burned, and while it is burning a general struggle takes
      place for the pieces, which are pulled out of the flames with bare hands.
      (Compare the struggle among the Khonds, and also at the Potraj festival
      and the Holne sacrifice.) Each person who secures a fragment of the figure
      ties it to a branch of the largest tree in his garden, or buries it in his
      field, in the <span class="pagenum">294</span><a name="link294"
      id="link294"></a>belief that this causes the crops to grow better.
      Sometimes a sheaf of corn does duty for the victim, and portions of it are
      buried in each field as fertilisers. In the Hartz Mountains, at similar
      ceremonies, a living man is laid on a baking-trough and carried with
      dirges to a grave; but a glass of brandy is substituted for him at the
      last moment. Here the spirit is the equivalent of a god. In other cases
      the man is actually covered with straw, and so lightly buried. In Italy
      and Spain, a similar custom bore the name of &ldquo;Sawing the Old Woman.&rdquo;
      In Palermo, a real old woman was drawn through the streets on a cart, and
      made to mount a scaffold, where two mock executioners proceeded to saw
      through a bladder of blood which had been fitted to her neck. The blood
      gushed out, and the old woman pretended to swoon and die. This is
      obviously a mitigation of a human sacrifice. At Florence, an effigy
      stuffed with walnuts and dried figs represented the Old Woman. At
      mid-Lent, this figure was sawn through the middle in the Mercato Nuovo,
      and when the dried fruits tumbled out they were scrambled for by the
      crowd, as savages scrambled for fragments of the human victim or his
      animal representative. Upon all this subject a mass of material has been
      collected by Mannhardt and Mr. Frazer. Perhaps the most interesting case
      of all is the Russian ceremony of the Funeral of Yarilo. In this instance,
      the people chose an old man and gave him a small coffin containing a
      figure representing Yarilo. This he carried out of the town, followed by
      women chanting dirges, as the Syrian women mourned for Adonis, and the
      Egyptians for Osiris. In the open fields a grave was dug, and into it the
      figure was lowered amid weeping and wailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myth and folk-lore also retain many traces of the primitive connexion.
      Thus, in the genuine American legend of Hiawatha, the hero wrestles with
      and vanquishes Mon-damin, and where he buries him springs up for the first
      time the maize, or Indian-corn plant. Similar episodes occur <span
      class="pagenum">295</span><a name="link295" id="link295"></a>in the
      Finnish Kalevala and other barbaric epics. According to Mr. Chalmers, the
      Motu tribe in New Guinea say that yams sprang first from the bones of a
      murdered man, which were buried in a grave. After some time, the grave was
      opened, and the bones were found to be no longer bones, but large and
      small yams of different colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to complete our preliminary survey of these artificial gods of
      cultivation, before we proceed to the consideration of the great corn-gods
      and wine-gods, it may be well to premise that in theory at least the
      original victim seems to have been a king or chief, himself divine, or
      else at least a king&rsquo;s son or daughter, one of the divine stock, in
      whose veins flowed the blood of the earlier deities. Later on, it would
      seem, the temporary king was often allowed to do duty for the real king;
      and for this purpose he seems frequently to have been clad in royal robes,
      and treated with divine and royal honours. Examples of this complication
      will crop up in the sequel. For the present I will only refer to the
      interesting set of survivals, collected by Mr. Gomme, where temporary
      kings or mayors in England are annually elected, apparently for the sake
      of being sacrificed only. In many of these cases we get mere fragmentary
      portions of the original rite; but by piecing them all together, we obtain
      on the whole a tolerably complete picture of the original ceremonial
      observance. At St. Germans in Cornwall, the mock mayor was chosen under
      the large walnut-tree at the May-fair; he was made drunk overnight, in
      order to fit him for office, and was in that state drawn round the
      nut-tree, much as we saw the mayor of Bovey rode round the Bovey stone on
      his accession to the mayoralty. The mayor of St. Germans also displayed
      his royal character by being mounted on the wain or cart of old Teutonic
      and Celtic sovereignty. At Lostwithiel, the mock mayor was dressed with a
      crown on his head, and a sceptre in his hand, and had a sword borne before
      him. At Penrhyn, the mayor was preceded by torch-bearers and town
      sergeants, and though he was not <span class="pagenum">296</span><a
      name="link296" id="link296"></a>actually burnt, either in play or in
      effigy, bonfires were lighted, and fireworks discharged, which connect the
      ceremony with such pyre-sacrifices of cremationists as the festival of the
      Tyrian Melcarth and the Baal of Tarsus. On Halgaver Moor, near Bodmin, a
      stranger was arrested, solemnly tried in sport, and then trained in the
      mire or otherwise ill-treated. At Polperro, the mayor was gen-rally
      &ldquo;some half-witted or drunken fellow,&rdquo; in either case,
      according to early ideas, divine; he was treated with ale, and, &ldquo;having
      completed the perambulation of the town,&rdquo; was wheeled by his
      attendants into the sea. There, he was allowed to scramble out again, as
      the mock victim does in many European ceremonies; but originally, I do not
      doubt, he was drowned as a rain-charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ceremonies, at the time when our authorities learnt of them, had all
      degenerated to the level of mere childish pastimes; but they contain in
      them, none the less, persistent elements of most tragic significance, and
      they point back to hideous and sanguinary god-making festivals. In most of
      them we see still preserved the choice of the willing or unconscious
      victim; the preference for a stranger, a fool, or an idiot; the habit of
      intoxicating the chosen person; the treatment of the victim as king,
      mayor, or governor; his scourging or mocking; his final death; and his
      burning on a pyre, or his drowning as a rain-charm. All these points are
      still more clearly noticeable in the other form of survival where the king
      or divine victim is represented, not by a mock or temporary king, but by
      an image or effigy. Such is the common case of King Carnival, who is at
      last burnt in all his regalia, or thrown into a river. Our own Guy Fawkes,
      though fastened upon the personality of a particular unpopular historical
      character, seems to be the last feeble English representative of such a
      human victim. I will not elaborate this point any further (considerations
      of space forbid), but will refer the reader for additional examples to Mr.
      Gomme&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">297</span><a name="link297"
      id="link297"></a><i>Village Community</i>, and Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s
      wonderful collection of examples in <i>The Golden Bough</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general conclusion I would incline to draw from all these instances is
      briefly this. Cultivation probably began with the accidental sowing of
      grains upon the tumuli of the dead. Gradually it was found that by
      extending the dug or tilled area and sowing it all over, a crop would grow
      upon it, provided always a corpse was buried in the centre. In process of
      time divine corpses were annually provided for the purpose, and buried
      with great ceremony in each field. By-and-bye it was found sufficient to
      offer up a single victim for a whole tribe or village, and to divide his
      body piecemeal among the fields of the community. But the crops that grew
      in such fields were still regarded as the direct gifts of the dead and
      deified victims, whose soul was supposed to animate and fertilize them. As
      cultivation spread, men became familiarised at last with the conception of
      the seed and the ploughing as the really essential elements in the
      process; but they still continued to attach to the victim a religious
      importance, and to believe in the necessity of his presence for good luck
      in the harvest. With the gradual mitigation of savagery an animal
      sacrifice was often substituted for a human one; but the fragments of the
      animal were still distributed through the fields with a mimic or
      symbolical burial, just as the fragments of the man-god had formerly been
      distributed. Finally, under the influence of Christianity and other
      civilised religions, an effigy was substituted for a human victim, though
      an animal sacrifice was often retained side by side with it, and a real
      human being was playfully killed in pantomime.
    </p>
    <p>
      In early stages, however, I note that the field or garden sometimes
      retains the form of a tumulus. Thus Mr. Turner, the Samoan missionary,
      writes of the people of Tana, in the New Hebrides:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They bestow a great deal of labour on their yam plantations, and
      keep them in fine order. You look over a reed <span class="pagenum">298</span><a
      name="link298" id="link298"></a>fence, and there you see ten or twenty
      mounds of earth, some of them seven feet high and sixty in circumference.
      These are heaps of loose earth without a single stone, all thrown up by
      the hand. In the centre they plant one of the largest yams whole, and
      round the sides some smaller ones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This looks very much like a tumulus in its <i>temenos</i>. I should
      greatly like to know whether a victim is buried in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may add that the idea of the crop being a gift from the deified ancestor
      or the divine-human victim is kept up in the common habit of offering the
      first-fruits to the dead, or to the gods, or to the living chief, their
      representative and descendant. Of the equivalence of these three
      ceremonies, I have given some evidence in my essay on Tree-Worship
      appended to my translation of the <i>Attis</i> of Catullus. For example,
      Mr. Turner says of these same Tanese in the New Hebrides:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirits of their departed ancestors were among their gods.
      Chiefs who reached an advanced age were, after death, deified, addressed
      by name, and prayed to on various occasions. They were supposed especially
      to preside over the growth of the yams and the different fruit-trees. The
      first-fruits were presented to them, and in doing this they laid a little
      of the fruit on some stone or shelving branch of the tree, or some more
      temporary altar.., in the form of a table.... All being quiet, the chief
      acted as high priest and prayed aloud thus: &lsquo;Compassionate father,
      here is some food for you; eat it; be kind to us on account of it.&rsquo;
      And instead of an Amen, all united in a loud shout.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar evidence is abundant elsewhere. I summarise a little of it. Every
      year the Kochs of Assam, when they gather their first-fruits, offer some
      to their ancestors, calling them even by name, and clapping their hands to
      summon them. The people of Kobi and Sariputi, two villages in Ceram,
      &ldquo;offer the first-fruits of the paddy in the form of cooked rice to
      their ancestors as a token of gratitude.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">299</span><a
      name="link299" id="link299"></a>The ceremony is called &ldquo;Feeding the
      Dead.&rdquo; In the Tenimber and Timorlaut Islands, the first-fruits of
      the paddy are offered to the spirits of the ancestors, who are worshipped
      as guardian gods or household lares. The people of Luzon worship chiefly
      the souls of their ancestors, and offer to them the first-fruits of the
      harvest. In Fiji the earliest of the yams are presented to the ancestral
      ghosts in the sacred stone enclosure; and no man may taste of the new crop
      till after this presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other cases it is gods rather than ghosts to whom the offering is made,
      though among savages the distinction is for the most part an elusive one.
      But in not a few instances the first-fruits are offered, not to spirits or
      gods at all, but to the divine king himself, who is the living
      representative and earthly counterpart of his deified ancestors. Thus in
      Ashantee a harvest festival is held in September, when the yams are ripe.
      During the festival the king eats the new yams, but none of the people may
      eat them till the close of the festival, which lasts a fortnight. The
      Hovas, of Madagascar, present the first sheaves of the new grain to the
      sovereign. The sheaves are carried in procession to the palace from time
      to time as the grain ripens. So, in Burmah, when the pangati fruits ripen,
      some of them used to be taken to the king&rsquo;s palace that he might eat
      of them; no one might partake of them before the king. In short, what is
      offered in one place to the living chief is offered in another place to
      his dead predecessor, and is offered in a third place to the great deity
      who has grown slowly out of them. The god is the dead king; the king, as
      in ancient Egypt, is the living god, and the descendant of gods, his
      deified ancestors. Indeed, the first-fruits seem sometimes to be offered
      to the human victim himself, in his deified capacity, and sometimes to the
      Adonis, or Osiris, who is his crystallised embodiment. Our own harvest
      festival seems to preserve the offering in a Christianised form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I will add that in many cases it looks as though the <span
      class="pagenum">300</span><a name="link300" id="link300"></a>divine
      agriculture-victim were regarded as the king in person, the embodiment of
      the village or tribal god, and were offered up, himself to himself, at the
      stone which forms the monument and altar of the primitive deity. Of this
      idea we shall see examples when we go on to examine the great corn-gods
      and wine-gods of the Mediterranean region.

      communities, the agricultural gods with whom we dealt in the last chapter

      harvest; and rise to great distinction in the various religions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I propose to examine at some length the more important of these in the
      Mediterranean civilisations, where Christianity was first evolved. And I
      begin with Dionysus.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the notable features of the Potraj festival of southern India,
      which Sir Walter Elliot has minutely described for us, and of which I gave
      a brief abstract in the previous chapter, is its orgiastic character. As
      type of the orgiastic god-making ceremonies, with their five-day festival,
      it well deserves some fuller description. The feast takes place near the
      temple of the village goddess, who is worshipped in the form of an
      unshapely stone, stained red with vermillion, the probable representative
      of the first human foundation-victim. An altar was erected behind this
      temple to the god who bears the name of Potraj. He is a deity of
      cultivation. The festival itself was under the charge of the Pariahs, or
      aboriginal outcasts; it was attended by all the lowest classes, including
      the dancing girls of the temple and the shepherds or other &ldquo;non-Aryan&rdquo;
      castes. During the festival, these people took temporarily the first place
      in the village; they appeared to <span class="pagenum">302</span><a
      name="link302" id="link302"></a>form the court of the temporary king, and
      to represent the early local worship, whose gods the conquering races are
      afraid of offending. For since the dead of the conquered race are in
      possession of the soil, immigrant conquerors everywhere have a
      superstitious dread of incurring their displeasure. On the first day of
      the orgy, the low-caste people chose one of themselves as priest or
      Potraj.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day of the feast, the sacred buffalo, already described as
      having the character of a theanthropic victim, was thrown down before the
      goddess; its head was struck off at a single blow, and was placed in front
      of the shrine, with one leg in its mouth. The carcase, as we saw already,
      was then cut up, and delivered to the cultivators to bury in their fields.
      The blood and offal were afterwards collected into a large basket; and the
      officiating priest, a low-caste man, who bore (like the god) the name of
      Potraj, taking a live kid, hewed it in pieces over the mess. The basket
      was then placed on the head of a naked man, of the leather-dresser class,
      who ran with it round the circuit of the village boundaries, scattering
      the fragments right and left as he went. The Potraj was armed with a
      sacred whip, like Osiris; and this whip was itself the object of profound
      veneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third and fourth days, many buffaloes and sheep were slaughtered;
      and on the fourth day, women walked naked to the temple, clad in boughs of
      trees alone; a common religious exercise of which I have only space here
      to suggest that St. Elizabeth of Hungary and the Godiva procession at
      Coventry are surviving relics. (These relations have well been elucidated
      by Mr. Sidney Hartland.)
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifth and last day, the whole community marched with music to the
      village temple, and offered a concluding sacrifice at the Potraj altar. A
      lamb was concealed close by. The Potraj, having found it after a pretended
      search, rendered it insensible by a blow of his whip, or by mesmeric
      passes&mdash;a survival of the idea of the voluntary victim. Then the
      assistants tied the Potraj&rsquo;s hands behind his <span class="pagenum">303</span><a
      name="link303" id="link303"></a>back, and the whole party began to dance
      round him with orgiastic joy. Potraj joined in the excitement, and soon
      came under the present influence of the deity. He was led up, bound, to
      the place where the lamb lay motionless. Carried away with divine frenzy,
      he rushed at it, seized it with his teeth, tore through the skin, and eat
      into its throat. When it was quite dead, he was lifted up; a dishful of
      the meat-offering was presented to him; he thrust his blood-stained face
      into it, and it was then buried with the remains of the lamb beside the
      altar. After that, his arms were untied, and he fled the place. I may add
      that as a rule the slaughterer of the god everywhere has to fly from the
      vengeance of his worshippers, who, after participating in the attack,
      pretend indignation as soon as the sacrifice is completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the party now adjourned to the front of the temple, where a
      heap of grain deposited on the first day was divided among all the
      cultivators, to be sown by each one in the field with his piece of flesh.
      After this, a distribution was made of the piled-up heads of the buffaloes
      and sheep slaughtered on the third and fourth days. These were evidently
      considered as sacred as divine heads generally in all countries and ages.
      About forty of the sheeps&rsquo; heads were divided among certain
      privileged persons; for the remainder, a general scramble took place, men
      of all castes soon rolling together on the ground in a mess of putrid
      gore. For the buffaloes&rsquo; heads, only the Pariahs contended. Whoever
      was fortunate enough to secure one of either kind carried it off and
      buried it in his field. Of the special importance of the head in all such
      sacrifices, Mr. Gomme has collected many apposite examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings were terminated by a procession round the boundaries; the
      burial of the head of the sacred buffalo close to the shrine of the
      village goddess; and the outbreak of a perfect orgy, a &ldquo;rule of
      misrule,&rdquo; during which the chief musician indulged in unbridled
      abuse of all the authorities, native or British.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <span class="pagenum">304</span><a name="link304" id="link304"></a>have
      given at such length an account of this singular festival, partly because
      it sheds light upon much that has gone before, but partly also because it
      helps to explain many elements in the worship of the great corn- and
      wine-gods. One point of cardinal importance to be noticed here is that the
      officiating priest, who was at one time also both god and victim, is
      called Potraj like the deity whom he represents. So, too, in Phrygia the
      combined Attis-victim and Attis-priest bore the name of Attis; and so in
      Egypt the annual Osiris-offering bore the name of Osiris, whom he
      represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am right, therefore, in the analogy of the two feasts Dionysus was in
      his origin a corn-god, and later a vine-god, annually slain and buried in
      order that his blood might fertilise the field or the vineyard. In the
      Homeric period, he was still a general god of cultivation: only later did
      he become distinctively the grape-god and wine-deity. There was
      originally, I believe, a Dionysus in every village; and this divine victim
      was annually offered, himself to himself, with orgiastic rites like those
      of Potraj. Mr. Laurence Gomme has already in part pointed out this
      equation of the Hellenic and the Indian custom. The earliest form of
      Dionysus-worship, on this hypothesis, would be the one which survived in
      Chios and Tenedos, where a living human being was orgiastically torn to
      pieces at the feast of Dionysus. At Orchomenus, the human victim was by
      custom a woman of the family of the Oleiæ (so that there were women
      Dionysi): at the annual festival, the priest of Dionysus pursued these
      women with a drawn sword, and if he caught one, he had the right to slay
      her. (This is the sacred-chance victim.) In other places, the ceremony had
      been altered in historical times; thus at Potnice, in Boeotia, it was once
      the custom to slay a child as Dionysus; but later on, a goat, which was
      identified with the god, was substituted for the original human victim.
      The equivalence of the animal victim with the human god is shown by the
      fact that at Tenedos the newborn <span class="pagenum">305</span><a
      name="link305" id="link305"></a>calf sacrificed to Dionysus&mdash;or <i>as</i>
      Dionysus&mdash;was shod in buskins, while the mother cow was tended like a
      woman in childbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsewhere we find other orgiastic rites still more closely resembling the
      Indian pattern. Among the Cretans, a Dionysus was sacrificed biennially
      under the form of a bull; and the worshippers tore the living animal to
      pieces wildly with their teeth. Indeed, says Mr. Frazer, the rending and
      devouring of live bulls and calves seems to have been a regular feature of
      the Dionysiac rites. In some cities, again, the animal that took the place
      of the human victim was a kid. When the followers of Dionysus tore in
      pieces a live goat and drank its blood, they believed they were devouring
      the actual body and blood of the god. <i>This eating and drinking the god
      is an important point</i>, which will detain us again at a later stage of
      our enquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not desire to dwell too long upon any one deity, or rather class of
      deities; therefore I will say briefly here that when Dionysus became the
      annual or biennial vine-god victim, it was inevitable that his worshippers
      should have seen his resurrection and embodiment in the vine, and should
      have regarded the wine it yielded as the blood of the god. In this case,
      the identification was particularly natural, for could not every
      worshipper feel the god in the wine? and did not the divine spirit within
      it inspire and intoxicate him? To be &ldquo;full of the god&rdquo; was the
      natural expression for the resulting exhilaration; the cult of the
      wine-spirit is thus one of those which stands on the surest and most
      intimate personal basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death and resurrection of Dionysus are accordingly a physical reality.
      The god is annually killed in the flesh, as man, bull, or goat; and he
      rises again in the vine, to give his blood once more for the good of his
      votaries. Moreover, he may be used as a fertiliser for many other trees;
      and so we find Dionysus has many functions. He is variously adored as
      Dionysus of the tree, and more particularly <span class="pagenum">306</span><a
      name="link306" id="link306"></a>of the fruit-bearing fig and apple. His
      image, like those of other tree-gods already encountered, was often an
      upright post, without arms, but draped (like the <i>ashera</i>) in a
      mantle, and with a bearded mask to represent the head, while green boughs
      projecting from it marked his vegetable character. He was the patron of
      cultivated trees; prayers were offered to him to make trees grow; he was
      honoured by fruit-growers, who set up an image of him, in the shape of a
      natural tree-stump, in the midst of their orchards. (Compare that last
      degraded and utilitarian relic, the modern scarecrow.) For other equally
      interesting facts, I would refer the reader once more to Mr. Frazer, whose
      rich store I must not further rifle. It seems to me obvious from his
      collection of facts that there was originally everywhere a separate local
      Dionysus, an annual man-god or woman-god victim (for which a beast was
      later substituted), and that only slowly did the worship of the individual
      Dionysi pass into the general worship of one great idealised god Dionysus.
      The great gods are at first classes, not individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gomme has further pointed out three interesting points of resemblance
      between the Dionysiac rites and the Indian Potraj festival. In the first
      place, Dionysus is sometimes represented to his worshippers by his head
      only&mdash;no doubt a preserved oracular head; and in any case a parallel
      to the importance of the head in the Indian ceremony. In the second place,
      the sacrificer of the calf at Tenedos was driven out and stoned after the
      fulfilment of the rite&mdash;a counterpart of the Potraj fleeing from the
      place after the slaughter of the lamb. And in the third place, the women
      worshippers of Dionysus attended the rites nude, crowned with garlands,
      and daubed over with dirt&mdash;a counterpart of the naked female votaries
      surrounded with branches of trees in the Indian festival. All three of
      these points recur abundantly in similar ceremonies elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, I severely disregard mere myths, as darkeners of <span
      class="pagenum">307</span><a name="link307" id="link307"></a>counsel,
      confining my attention to the purely religious and practical elements of
      custom and worship. But it is worth while noting here for its illustrative
      value the Cretan Dionysus-myth, preserved for us in a Romanised form by
      Firmicus Maternus. Dionysus is there represented as the son of Zeus, a
      Cretan king; and this legend, dismissed cavalierly by Mr. Frazer as
      &ldquo;Euhemeristic,&rdquo; at least encloses the old idea that the
      Dionysus-victim was at first himself a divine god-king, connected by blood
      with the supreme god or founder of the community. Hera, the wife of Zeus,
      was jealous of the child, and lured him into an ambush, where he was set
      upon by her satellites the Titans, who cut him limb from limb, boiled his
      body with various herbs, and ate it. Other forms of the myth tell us how
      his mother Demeter pieced together his mangled remains, and made him young
      again. More often, however, Dionysus is the son of Semele, and various
      other versions are given of the mode of his resurrection. It is enough for
      our purpose that in all of them <i>the wine-god, after having been slain
      and torn limb from limb, rises again from the dead, and often ascends to
      his father Zeus in heaven</i>. The resurrection, visibly enacted, formed
      in many places a part of the rite; though I cannot agree with Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s
      apparent and (for him) unusual suggestion that the rite grew out of the
      myth; I hold the exact opposite to have been the order of evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, then, though I do not deny that the later Greeks envisaged
      Dionysus as a single supreme god of vegetation, nor that many abstract
      ideas were finally fathered upon the worship&mdash;especially those which
      identified the death and resurrection of the god with the annual winter
      sleep and spring revival&mdash;I maintain that in his origin the Dionysus
      was nothing more than the annual corn-victim, afterwards extended into the
      tree and vine victim, from whose grave sprang the pomegranate, that
      blood-red fruit, and whose life-juice was expressed as the god-giving
      wine. At first a yearly human victim, he was afterwards personated <span
      class="pagenum">308</span><a name="link308" id="link308"></a>by a goat or
      a bull; and was therefore represented in art as a bull, or a bull-horned
      man. Gradually identified with vegetation in general, he was regarded at
      last as the Flowery Dionysus, the Fig Dionysus, or even, like Attis, the
      god of the pine-tree. But all these, I believe, were later syncretic
      additions; and I consider that in such primitive forms as the orgiastic
      crop-god of the Indian corn-festival we get the prime original of the
      Hellenic vine-deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pass on to Osiris, in his secondary or acquired character as corn-god.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already expressed the belief, in which I am backed up by Mr.
      Loftie, that the original Osiris was a real historical early king of This
      by Abydos. But in the later Egyptian religion, after mystic ideas had
      begun to be evolved, he came to be regarded as the god of the dead, and
      every mummy or every justified soul was looked upon as an Osiris.
      Moreover, it seems probable that in Egypt the name of Osiris was also
      fitted to the annual slain corn-victim or corn-god. Thus all over Egypt
      there were many duplicates of Osiris; notably at Busiris, where the name
      was attached to an early tomb like the one at Abydos. This identification
      of the new-made god with the historic ancestor, the dead king, or the
      tribal deity is quite habitual; it is parallel to the identification of
      the officiating Potraj with the Potraj god, of the Attis-priest with
      Attis, of the Dionysus-victim with the son of Zeus: and it will meet us
      hereafter in savage parallels. Let us look at the evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in India, the Osiris festival lasted for five days. (The period is
      worth noting.) The ceremonies began with ploughing the earth. We do not
      know for certain that a human victim was immolated; but many
      side-analogies would lead us to that conclusion, and suggest that as
      elsewhere the sacred victim was torn to pieces in the eagerness of the
      cultivators and worshippers to obtain a fragment of his fertilising body.
      For in the myth, Typhon cuts up the corpse of the god into fourteen
      pieces, which he <span class="pagenum">309</span><a name="link309"
      id="link309"></a>scatters abroad (as the naked leather-dresser scatters
      the sacred buffalo): and we know that in the Egyptian ceremonies one chief
      element was the search for the mangled portions of Osiris, the rejoicings
      at their discovery, and their solemn burial. On one of the days of the
      feast, a procession of priests went the round of the temples&mdash;or beat
      the bounds: and the festival closed with the erection of a pillar or stone
      monument to the Osiris, which, in a bas-relief, the king himself is
      represented as assisting in raising. I think it is impossible to overlook
      the general resemblance of these rites to the rites of Potraj.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to add, though I cannot go into that matter fully here, that the
      many allusions to the flinging of the coffer containing the Osiris into
      the Nile are clear indications of the rain-charm obtained by throwing the
      human victim into a spring or river. In this case, however, it must of
      course be regarded locally as a charm to make the Nile rise in due season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character of the later Osiris, or the god-victim identified with him,
      as a corn and vegetable god, is amply borne out by several other pieces of
      evidence. Osiris, it is said, was the first to teach men the use of corn.
      He also introduced the cultivation of the vine. Mr. Frazer notes that in
      one of the chambers dedicated to Osiris in the great temple of Isis at
      Philæ, the dead body of Osiris is represented with stalks of corn
      springing from it, and a priest is watering the stalks from a pitcher
      which he holds in his hand. That human corn-victims were at least not
      unknown in Egypt we have on the direct authority of Manetho, who tells us
      that red-haired men used to be burned, and their ashes scattered with
      winnowing fans. (Similar cases elsewhere have been previously mentioned.)
      So, too, the legend tells us that Isis placed the severed limbs of Osiris
      on a corn-sieve. Red-haired oxen were also sacrificed in Egypt, apparently
      in order to produce red wheat. This is the analogue of the bull sacrificed
      as Dionysus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, <span class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310" id="link310"></a>in
      the legend of Busiris, and the glosses or comments upon it, we get
      important evidence, the value of which has not fully been noted, I
      believe, by Mr. Frazer. The story comes to us in a Greek form; but we can
      see through it that it represents the myth which accounted for the Osiris
      sacrifice. The name Busiris means the city of Osiris, which was so called
      because the grave of an ancient Osiris (either a mummy, or a local chief
      identified with the great god of Abydos) was situated there. Human
      sacrifices were said to have been offered at his tomb; just as the Potraj
      sacrifice is offered at the shrine of the village goddess, and just as the
      annual victim elsewhere was sacrificed at the Terminus stone or the sacred
      stone of the foundation-god or goddess. The victims were redhaired men,
      and strangers. Their ashes were scattered abroad with winnowing fans. They
      were slain on the harvest-field, and mourned by the reapers (like Adonis
      and Attis) in the song which through a Greek mistake is known to us as the
      Maneros. The reapers prayed at the same time that Osiris might revive and
      return with renewed vigour in the following year. The most interesting
      point in this account, pieced together from Apollodorus, Diodorus, and
      Plutarch, is the fact that it shows us how the annual Osiris was
      identified with the old divine king who lay in his grave hard by; and so
      brings the case into line with others we have already considered and must
      still consider. As for the hunting after the pieces of Osiris&rsquo;s
      body, that is just like the hunting after the mangled pieces of Dionysus
      by Demeter. I interpret both the resurrection of Osiris, and the story of
      the fragments being pieced together and growing young again, told of
      Dionysus, as meaning that the scattered pieces, buried like those of the
      Khond Meriah, grow up again next year into the living corn for the
      harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, there exists to this day in Egypt an apparent survival of the
      ancient Osiris rite, in an attenuated form (like the mock mayors in
      England), which distinctly suggests <span class="pagenum">311</span><a
      name="link311" id="link311"></a>the identification I am here attempting.
      In Upper Egypt, Klunzinger tells us, on the first day of the (Egyptian)
      solar year, when the Nile has usually reached its highest point, the
      regular government is suspended for three days in each district, and every
      town chooses its own temporary ruler. This temporary king (a local Osiris,
      as I believe) wears a conical cap, and a long flaxen beard, and is
      enveloped in a strange mantle. I say unhesitatingly, the dress of an
      Osiris, wearing the old royal cap of Upper Egypt. With a wand of office in
      his hands&mdash;like the crook which Osiris carries on the monuments&mdash;and
      attended by men disguised as scribes, executioners, and so forth, he
      proceeds to the governor&rsquo;s house. The governor allows himself to be
      deposed; the mock king, mounting the throne, holds a tribunal, to whose
      decisions even the governor himself must bow. In short, like other
      temporary kings, he really enjoys royal authority for the moment. After
      three days, however, the mock king is condemned to death; the envelope or
      shell in which he is encased is committed to the flames; and from its
      ashes creeps forth the Fellah who impersonated him. I do not doubt that
      the case here represents the antique coffer or mummy-case of Osiris.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this graphic ceremonial, then, I see a survival, with the customary
      mitigations, of the annual Osiris sacrifice, once actually performed on a
      human victim. I do not doubt that in Egypt as elsewhere a mock king was
      formerly chosen in place of the real king to personate the descendant of
      Osiris, an Osiris himself; and that this substitute was put to death, and
      torn to pieces or burnt, while his ashes were winnowed and scattered over
      the land. It may also be worth while to enquire whether the scourge which
      Osiris holds in the bas-reliefs is not the equivalent of the divine whip
      of the Potraj, and the other whips which Mr. Gomme has so ingeniously
      correlated with that very venerable and mystic attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would suggest, then, that Osiris in his later embodiment <span
      class="pagenum">312</span><a name="link312" id="link312"></a>was annually
      renewed as a corn and vine victim. Originally a king of Upper Egypt, or
      part of it, he was envisaged in later myth as a general culture-god. Isis,
      his sister and wife, discovered wheat and barley growing wild; and Osiris
      introduced these grains among his people, who thereupon abandoned
      cannibalism, and took to grain-growing. An annual victim, most often a
      stranger, identified with the racial god, was torn to pieces in his place;
      and Osiris himself was finally merged with the abstract spirit of
      vegetation, and supposed to be the parent of all trees. Just as the
      Corinthians, when ordered by an oracle to worship a certain pine tree
      &ldquo;equally with the god,&rdquo; cut it down and made two images of
      Dionysus out of it, with gilt bodies and red-stained faces; so the
      Egyptians cut down a pine-tree, took out the heart, made an image of
      Osiris, and then buried it in the hollow of the tree from which it had
      been taken. Similar rites obtained in Attis-worship and all alike bear
      witness to that late and abstract stage of thought where the primitive
      cultivation-victim has been sublimated and elevated into a generalised god
      of vegetation in the abstract. But this, which for Mr. Frazer is the
      starting-point, is for me the goal of the evolution of Osiris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us next look very briefly at the case of Adonis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Adon or Lord commonly known as Thammuz was one of the chief elements
      in Syrian religion. He was closely connected with the namesake river
      Adonis, which rose by his grave at the sacred spring of Aphaca. We do not
      actually know, I believe, of a human Adonis-victim; but his death was
      annually lamented with a bitter wailing, chiefly by women. Images of him
      were dressed like corpses, and carried out as if for burial, and then
      thrown into the sea or into springs. This was evidently a rain charm, such
      as is particularly natural in a dry country like Syria. And I will add
      incidentally that I attribute to similar circumstances also some portion
      at least of the sanctity of rivers. In certain places, the resurrection of
      the Adonis was <span class="pagenum">313</span><a name="link313"
      id="link313"></a>celebrated on the succeeding day. At Byblos, he also
      ascended into heaven before the eyes of his worshippers&mdash;a point
      worth notice from its Christian analogies. The blood-red hue of the river
      Adonis in spring&mdash;really due to the discoloration of the tributary
      torrents by red earth from the mountains&mdash;was set down to the blood
      of the god Adonis; the scarlet anemone sprang from his wounds. But the
      scholiast on Theocritus expressly explains the Adonis as &ldquo;the sown
      corn;&rdquo; and that he was &ldquo;seed,&rdquo; like the common
      corn-victims in India and elsewhere, we can hardly doubt from the repeated
      stories of his death and resurrection. The so-called &ldquo;gardens of
      Adonis,&rdquo; which were mimic representations of a tumulus planted with
      corn, formed a most noticeable part of the god&rsquo;s ritual. They
      consisted of baskets or pots, filled with earth, in which wheat, barley,
      flowers, and so forth were sown and tended by women; and at the end of
      eight days they were carried out with the images of the dead Adonis, and
      flung into the sea or into springs. This was no doubt another case of a
      rain-charm. Mr. Frazer has collected several interesting examples of
      similar rites the whole world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few other embodiments of the corn-god may be more hastily treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Adonis was to Syria, Attis was to Phrygia. Originally he seems,
      according to Professor Ramsay, to have been represented by an annual
      priest-victim, who slew himself for the people to ensure fertility. This
      priest-victim himself bore the name of Attis, and was identified with the
      god whose worship he performed. In later days, instead of killing himself,
      he merely drew his own blood; and there is reason to think that a pig was
      also substituted as duplicate victim, and that this pig was itself
      regarded as an Attis. Analogies exist with the Paschal lamb; while the
      self-mutilation of Attis-worship has also features in common with Jewish
      circumcision. Moreover, the ceremonies were closely connected, at Pessinus
      at least, with the ancient sacred stone which bore the name of Cybele, and
      which was <span class="pagenum">314</span><a name="link314" id="link314"></a>described
      as the Mother of the Gods; this connexion exactly recalls that of the
      Potraj-god in India with the cult of the local village goddess. As I
      believe the village goddess to be the permanent form of the foundation
      human sacrifice, I also believe Cybele (gross Euhemerism as it may seem)
      to be the sacred stone of the original virgin who was sacrificed at the
      first foundation of Pessinus.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sacred stone of Cybele and the cult of Attis were removed to Rome
      (under circumstances to which I shall refer in a later chapter) the
      festival consisted of a five days&rsquo; rite, like that of the Potraj. It
      took place at the spring equinox, as does our own equivalent festival of
      Easter. On the first day, a pine-tree was cut down in the woods, and the
      effigy of a young man was tied to it. This effigy no doubt represented the
      primitive human sacrifice, and its crucifixion answers exactly to the
      slaughter of the sacred buffalo in India. The second day yields nothing of
      importance; on the third day, the Attis-priest drew blood from his own
      arms and presented it as an offering; I would conjecture that this was a
      substitute for self-immolation, and that the self-immolation was
      originally performed by mutilation of the genitals. It was perhaps on this
      night that a mourning took place over the body of Attis, represented by an
      effigy, which was afterwards solemnly buried. On the fourth day came the
      Festival of Joy, on which, as Mr. Frazer believes, the resurrection of the
      god was celebrated. The fifth day closed with a procession to the brook
      Almo, in which the sacred stone of the goddess and her bullock-cart were
      bathed as a rain-charm. On the return, the cart was strewn with flowers. I
      think the close parallelism to the Indian usage is here fairly evident.
      Indeed, out of consideration for brevity, I have suppressed several other
      most curious resemblances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attis was thus essentially a corn-god. His death and resurrection were
      annually celebrated at Rome and at Pessinus. An Attis of some sort died
      yearly. The Attis of Pessinus was both priest and king; it was perhaps at
      one time <span class="pagenum">315</span><a name="link315" id="link315"></a>his
      duty to die at the end of his yearly reign as a corn-god for his people.
      One epithet of Attis was &ldquo;very fruitful&rdquo;; he was addressed as
      &ldquo;the reaped yellow ear of corn&rdquo;; and when an effigy took the
      place of the annual slain priest-king, this effigy itself was kept for a
      year, and then burnt as the priest-king himself would have been at an
      earlier period. It seems to me impossible to resist the cumulative weight
      of this singular evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the very curious customs and myths regarding Demeter, Persephone, and
      other female corn-victims, I must refer the reader once more to Mr.
      Frazer. It is true, the enquirer will there find the subject treated from
      the opposite standpoint; he will see the goddesses regarded as first
      corn-spirits, then animal, finally human: but after the examples I have
      here given of my own mode of envisaging the facts, I think the reader will
      see for himself what corrections to make for Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s animism
      and personal equation. I will only say here that in many countries, from
      Peru to Africa, a girl or woman seems to have been offered up as a
      corn-goddess; that this corn-goddess seems to have been sown with the
      seed, and believed to come to life again with the corn; and that several
      European harvest customs appear to be mitigations of the old ceremonial,
      with the usual substitution of an animal or an effigy for the human
      victim. Regarded in this light, Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s collection of facts
      about the Corn Baby affords an excellent groundwork for research; but
      though I could say much on the subject, I will refrain from it here, as I
      desire only at present to give such an outline as will enable the reader
      to understand my general principles. The half is often more than the
      whole; and I fear if I flesh out the framework too much, it may be
      difficult to follow the main line of my argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot, however, refrain from mentioning that the ceremonies of &ldquo;Carrying
      out Death&rdquo; and &ldquo;Burying the Carnival,&rdquo; which prevail all
      over Europe, retain many interesting features of the Potraj, Dionysus, and
      Attis-Adonis <span class="pagenum">316</span><a name="link316" id="link316"></a>festivals.
      The figure of Death&mdash;that is to say, as I understand it, the image of
      the dead human god&mdash;is often torn to pieces, and the fragments are
      then buried in the fields to make the crops grow well. But the Death is
      also drowned or burned; in the first case, like Adonis, in the second,
      like the Osiris in the modern Egyptian custom. And the analogies of the
      festivals to those of India and Western Asia must strike every attentive
      reader of Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s masterwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three typical instances must suffice as examples. In Bohemia, the
      children carry a straw man out of the village, calling it Death, and then
      burn it, singing,=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now
      carry we Death out of the village,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      new summer into the village;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome,
      dear summer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green
      little corn.=
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the relation of the ceremony to the primitive corn-sacrifice is
      immediately evident. And the making of the effigy out of straw is
      significant. At Tabor in Bohemia the image of Death is flung from a high
      rock into the water, evidently as a rain-charm, with a similar song,
      praying for &ldquo;good wheat and rye.&rdquo; (Compare the ceremony of the
      Tarpeian rock, where the victim was at last a condemned criminal: as also
      the myths of immolation by jumping into the sea.) In Lower Bavaria the
      pantomime was more realistic; the <i>Pfingstl</i>, as the victim was
      called, was clad in leaves and flowers, and drenched with water. He waded
      into a brook up to his middle, while a boy pretended to cut off his head.
      In Saxony and Thüringen, the Wild Man, who represents the god, is killed
      in dumb show at Whitsuntide. His captors pretend to shoot him, and he
      falls as if dead, but is afterwards revived, as in the resurrection of
      Adonis and Dionysus. Such resurrections form a common episode in the
      popular corn-drama. I have found a case in Sussex. At Semic in Bohemia we
      have the further graphic point that the victim is actually described as
      the King, wears a crown of bark, and carries a wand as a <span
      class="pagenum">317</span><a name="link317" id="link317"></a>sceptre, like
      the mock Osiris. Other kings are frequent elsewhere. In the Koniggratz
      district, the King is tried, and, if condemned, is beheaded in pantomime.
      Near Schomberg, the mock victim used to be known as the Fool, another
      significant name, and was finally buried under straw and dung, a
      conjunction of obvious agricultural import. In Rottweil, the Fool is made
      drunk, and interred in straw amid Adonis-like lamentations. Elsewhere, the
      Fool, either in person or by a straw effigy, is flung into water. At
      Schluckenau, realism goes a stage further: the Wild Man wears a bladder
      filled with blood round his neck; this the executioner stabs, and the
      blood gushes forth on the ground. Next day, a straw man, made to look as
      like him as possible, is laid on a bier, and taken to a pool into which it
      is flung. In all these antique ceremonies it is impossible not to see a
      now playful survival of the primitive corn-sacrifice. Our own April Fool
      shows the last stage of degradation in such world-wide customs. Originally
      sent on a fool&rsquo;s errand to the place of sacrifice, so that he might
      go voluntarily, he is now merely sent in meaningless derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will only add here that while corn-gods and wine-gods are the most
      notable members of this strange group of artificial deities, the sacred
      date-palm has its importance as well in the religions of Mesopotamia; and
      elsewhere the gods of the maize, the plantain, and the cocoanut rise into
      special or local prominence.&rsquo; So do the Rice-Spirit, the Oats-Wife,
      the Mother of the Rye, and the Mother of the Barley (or Demeter). All seem
      to be modifications of the primitive victim, sacrificed to make a spirit
      for the crop, or to act as &ldquo;seed&rdquo; for the date or the
      plantain.

      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;SACRIFICE AND SACRAMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E <span
      class="pagenum">318</span><a name="link318" id="link318"></a>have now
      arrived at a point where we can more fully understand <i>those curious
      ideas of sacrifice and sacrament which lie at the root of so much that is
      essential in the Jewish, the Christian, and most other religions</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Galton tells us that to the Damaras, when he travelled among them, all
      meat was common property. No one killed an ox except as a sacrifice and on
      a festal occasion; and when the ox was killed, the whole community feasted
      upon it indiscriminately. This is but a single instance of a feeling
      almost universal among primitive pastoral people. Cattle and other
      domestic animals, being regarded as sacred, are rarely killed; and when
      they are killed, they are eaten at a feast as a social and practically
      religious rite&mdash;in short, sacramentally. I need not give instances of
      so well-known a principle; I will content myself with quoting what Dr.
      Robertson Smith says of a particular race: &ldquo;Among the early Semites
      generally, no slaughter was legitimate except for sacrifice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbaric herdsmen, indeed, can hardly conceive of men to whom flesh meat
      is a daily article of diet. Mr. Galton found the idea very strange to his
      Damaras. Primitive pastoral races keep their domestic animals mainly for
      the sake of the milk, or as beasts of burden, or for the wool and hair;
      they seldom kill one except for a feast, at which the gods are
      fellow-partakers. Indeed, it is probable, as the sequel will suggest, that
      domestic animals were originally kept as totems or ancestor-gods, and that
      the habit of eating <span class="pagenum">319</span><a name="link319"
      id="link319"></a>the meat of sheep, goats, and oxen has arisen mainly out
      of the substitution of such a divine animal-victim for the divine
      human-victim of earlier usage. Our butchers&rsquo; shops have their origin
      in mitigated sacrificial cannibalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacrifice, regarded merely as offering to the gods, has thus, I believe,
      two distinct origins. Its earliest, simplest, and most natural form is
      that whose development we have already traced,&mdash;the placing of small
      articles of food and drink at the graves of ancestors or kings or revered
      fellow-tribesmen. That from a very early period men have believed the dead
      to eat and drink, whether as corpse, as mummy, as ghost of buried friend,
      or as ethereal spirit of cremated chieftain, we have already seen with
      sufficient frequency. About the origin of these simplest and most
      primitive sacrifices, I think, there can be little doubt. Savages offer at
      the graves of their dead precisely those ordinary articles of food which
      they consumed while living, without any distinction of kind; and they
      continue to offer them in the same naïve way when the ghost has progressed
      to the status of one of the great gods of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is another mode of sacrifice, superposed upon this, and
      gradually tending to be more or less identified with it, which yet, if I
      am right, had a quite different origin in the artificial production of
      gods about which I have written at considerable length in the last three
      chapters. The human or animal victim, thus slaughtered in order to make a
      new god or protecting spirit, came in time to be assimilated in thought to
      the older type of mere honorific offerings to the dead gods; and so <i>gave
      rise to those mystic ideas of the god who is sacrificed, himself to
      himself, of which the sacrament of the Mass is the final and most
      mysterious outcome</i>. Thus, the foundation-gods, originally killed in
      order to make a protecting spirit for a house or a tribal god for a city
      or village, came at last to be regarded as victims sacrificed to the Earth
      Goddess or to the Earth Demons; and thus, too, the Meriahs and other
      agricultural <span class="pagenum">320</span><a name="link320" id="link320"></a>victims,
      originally killed in order to make a corn-god or a corn-spirit, came at
      last to be regarded as sacrifices to the Earth, or to some abstract
      Dionysus or Attis or Adonis. And since in the last case at least the god
      and the victim were still called by the same name and recognised as one,
      there grew up at last in many lands, and in both hemispheres, but
      especially in the Eastern Mediterranean basin, the mystic theory of the
      sacrifice of a god, himself to himself, in atonement or expiation, which
      forms the basis of the Christian Plan of Salvation. It is this secondary
      and derivative form of sacrifice, I believe, which is mainly considered in
      Professor Robertson Smith&rsquo;s elaborate and extremely valuable
      analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that the secondary form of sacrifice, which for brevity&rsquo;s
      sake I shall henceforth designate as the mystic, is found in most parts of
      the world and in both hemispheres. This naturally raises the question
      whether it has a single common origin, and antedates the dispersal of
      mankind through the hemispheres; or whether it has been independently
      evolved several times over in many lands by many races. For myself, I have
      no cut-and-dried answer to this abstruse question, nor do I regard it,
      indeed, as a really important one. On the one hand, there are many reasons
      for supposing that certain relatively high traits of thought or art were
      common property among mankind before the dispersion from the primitive
      centre, if a primitive centre ever existed. On the other hand,
      psychologists know well that the human mind acts with extraordinary
      similarity in given circumstances all the world over, and that identical
      stages of evolution seem to have been passed through independently by many
      races, in Egypt and Mexico, in China and Peru; so that we can find nothing
      inherently improbable in the idea that even these complex conceptions of
      mystic sacrifice have distinct origins in remote countries. What is
      certain is the fact that among the Aztecs, as among the Phrygians, the
      priest who sacrificed, the victim he slew, and the image or great god to
      <span class="pagenum">321</span><a name="link321" id="link321"></a>whom he
      slew him, were all identified; the killer, the killed, and the being in
      whose honor the killing took place were all one single indivisible deity.
      Even such details as that the priest clothed himself in the skin of the
      victim are common to many lands; they may very well be either a heritage
      from remote ancestral humanity, or the separate product of the human mind,
      working along like grooves under identical conditions. In one word they
      may perhaps be necessary and inevitable corollaries from antecedent
      conceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must further premise that no religion as we now know it is by any means
      primitive. The most savage creeds we find among us have still hundreds of
      thousands of years behind them. The oldest religions whose records have
      descended to us, like those of Egypt and of Assyria, are still remote by
      hundreds of thousands of years from the prime original. Cultivation itself
      is a very ancient and immemorial art. Few savages, even among those who
      are commonly described as in the hunting stage, are wholly ignorant of
      some simple form of seed-sowing and tillage. The few who are now ignorant
      of those arts show some apparent signs of being rather degenerate than
      primitive peoples. My own belief or suspicion is that ideas derived from
      the set of practices in connexion with agriculture detailed in the last
      two chapters have deeply coloured the life and thought of almost the whole
      human race, including even those rudest tribes which now know little or
      nothing of agriculture. But I do not lay stress upon this half-formed
      conviction, to justify which would lead me too far afield. I shall be
      content with endeavouring to suggest how far they have coloured the ideas
      of the greater number of existing nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early pastoral races seldom kill a beast except on great occasions. When
      they kill it, they devour it in common, all the tribe being invited to the
      festival. But they also eat it in fellowship with their gods; every great
      feast is essentially a Theoxenion, a Lectisternium, a banquet in which the
      <span class="pagenum">322</span><a name="link322" id="link322"></a>deities
      participate with mortals. It is this sense of a common feast of gods and
      men which gave, no doubt, the first step towards the complex idea of the
      sacramental meal&mdash;an idea still further developed at a later stage by
      the addition of the concept that the worshipper eats and drinks the actual
      divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own belief is that all sacrificial feasts of this godeating character
      most probably originated in actual cannibalism; and that later an animal
      victim was substituted for the human meat; but I do not insist on this
      point, nor attempt, strictly speaking, to prove it. It is hardly more than
      a deeply grounded suspicion. Nevertheless, I will begin for convenience&rsquo;
      sake with the cannibal class of sacrifice, and will come round in time to
      the familiar slaughter of sheep and oxen, which in many cases is known to
      have supplanted a human offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acosta&rsquo;s account of the Mexican custom is perhaps the best instance
      we now possess of the ritual of cannibal mystic sacrifice in its fullest
      barbarity. &ldquo;They took a captive,&rdquo; says that racy old author,
      &ldquo;at random; and before sacrificing him to their idols, they gave him
      the name of the idol to whom he should be sacrificed, and dressed him in
      the same ornaments, identifying him with the god. During the time that the
      identification lasted, which was for a year in some feasts, six months or
      less in others, they reverenced and worshipped him in the same manner as
      the idol itself. Meanwhile, he was allowed to eat, drink, and make merry.
      When he went through the streets, the people came forth to worship him;
      and every one brought alms, with children and sick people that he might
      cure them and bless them. He did as he pleased in everything except that
      he had ten or twelve men about him, to prevent him from escaping. In order
      that he might be reverenced as he passed, he sometimes sounded upon a
      small flute, to tell the people to worship him. When the feast arrived,
      and he had grown fat, they killed him, opened him, and making a solemn
      sacrifice, eat him.&rdquo; There, in the words <span class="pagenum">323</span><a
      name="link323" id="link323"></a>of a competent authority, we have the
      simple cannibal feast in its fullest nakedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need hardly point out how much this account recalls the Khond custom of
      the Meriah. The victim, though not really of royal blood, is made
      artificially into a divine king; he is treated with all the honours of
      royalty and godhead, is dressed like the deity with whom he is identified,
      and is finally killed and eaten. The last point alone differs in any large
      degree from the case of the Meriah. We have still to enquire, &ldquo;Why
      did they eat him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer to this enquiry takes us into the very heart and core of the
      sacramental concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>It is a common early belief that to eat of any particular animal gives
      you the qualities of that animal</i>. The Miris of Northern India prize
      tiger&rsquo;s flesh for men; it gives them strength and courage; but women
      must not eat it; &lsquo;twould make them &ldquo;too strong-minded.&rdquo;
      The Namaquas abstain from eating hare; they would become faint-hearted if
      they swallowed it; but they eat the meat of the lion or drink the blood of
      the leopard, in order to gain their strength and courage. Among the Dyaks,
      young men and warriors must not eat deer; it would render them cowardly;
      but women and very old men are allowed to eat it. Men of the Buro and Aru
      Islands feed on the flesh of dogs in order to be bold and nimble. Mr.
      Frazer has collected an immense number of similar instances, which show
      both how widespread and how deep-seated are such beliefs. Even scrapings
      of the bones are sufficient to produce the desired result; in Corea, the
      bones of tigers fetch a higher price than those of leopards as inspirers
      of courage. The heart of a lion is also particularly good for this
      purpose; and the tongues of birds are recommended for eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, on the same analogy, the flesh and blood of brave men are eaten in
      order to inspire bravery. The Australian Kamilaroi eat the heart and liver
      of a valiant warrior in order to acquire his courage. The Philippine
      Islanders drink the blood of their bravest enemies. In the Shire Highlands
      <span class="pagenum">324</span><a name="link324" id="link324"></a>of
      Africa, those who kill a distinguished fighter eat his heart to get his
      courage. Du Chaillu&rsquo;s negro, attendants, we saw, scraped their
      ancestors&rsquo; skulls, and drank the powder in water. &ldquo;Our
      ancestors were brave,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;and by drinking their
      skulls, we shall be brave as they were.&rdquo; Here again I can only refer
      the reader for numerous examples to Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s inexhaustible
      storehouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of Du Chaillu&rsquo;s warriors, however, takes us with one bound
      into the heart of the subject. Many savages for similar reasons actually
      eat their own dead fathers. * We learn from Strabo that the ancient Irish
      &ldquo;deemed it honourable to devour the bodies of their parents.&rdquo;
      So, Herodotus tells us, did the Issedones of Central Asia. The Massagetæ
      used &ldquo;from compassion&rdquo; to club and eat their aged people. The
      custom was quite recently common among the Battas of Sumatra, who used
      &ldquo;religiously and ceremonially to eat their old relations.&rdquo; In
      Australia, it was usual to eat relatives who died by mischance. Of the
      Cucumas we read that &ldquo;as soon as a relation died, these people
      assembled and eat him roasted or boiled, according as he was thin or fat.&rdquo;
      The Tarianas and Tucanas, who drink the ashes of their relatives, &ldquo;believe
      that thus the virtues of the deceased will be transmitted to the drinkers.&rdquo;
      The Arawaks think it the highest mark of honour they could pay to the dead
      to drink their powdered bones mixed in water. Generally speaking, in a
      large number of cases, the parents or relatives were eaten in order
      &ldquo;not to let the life go out of the family&rdquo; or to preserve the
      bodies and souls in a kindred body; or to gain the courage and other
      qualities of the dead relation. <i>In short, the dead were eaten
      sacramentally or, as one writer even phrases it, &ldquo;eucharistically.&rdquo;</i>
      Mr. Hartland has collected many striking instances.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Since this chapter was written, the subject of honorific
     cannibalism has been far more fully treated by Mr. Sidney
     Hartland in the chapter on Funeral Rites, in the second
     volume of The Legend of Perseus.
</pre>
    <p>
      How this strange custom originates we may guess from Mr. <span
      class="pagenum">325</span><a name="link325" id="link325"></a>Wyatt Gill&rsquo;s
      description of a New Guinea funeral. &ldquo;The women lacerated their
      faces and beat their breasts most affectingly,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;and
      then, in the madness of their grief, pressed the matter out of the wounded
      thigh, and smeared it over their faces and persons, and even licked it up.&rdquo;
      Of the Koiari corpses he says: &ldquo;A fire is kept burning day and night
      at the head and feet for months. The entire skin is removed by means of
      the thumb and forefinger, and the juices plastered all over the face and
      body of the operator,&mdash;parent, husband, or wife of the deceased. The
      fire gradually desiccates the flesh, so that little more than the skeleton
      is left.&rdquo; This naturally leads on to eating the dead, which indeed
      is practised elsewhere in New Guinea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if men eat the bodies of their fathers, who are their family and
      household gods, they will also naturally eat the bodies of the artificial
      gods of cultivation, or of the temporary kings who die for the people. <i>By
      eating the body of a god, you absorb his divinity; he and you become one;
      he is in you and inspires you. This is the root-idea of sacramental
      practice; you eat your god by way of complete union; you subsume him in
      yourself; you and he are one being</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, how can you eat your god if you also bury him as a corn-spirit to
      use him as seed? The Gonds supply us with the answer to that obvious
      difficulty. For, as we saw, they sprinkle the blood of the victim over the
      ploughed field or ripe crop, and then they sacramentally devour his body.
      Such a double use of the artificial god is frequently to be detected,
      indeed, through the vague words of our authorities. We see it in the
      Potraj ceremony, where the blood of the lamb is drunk by the officiating
      priest, while the remainder of the animal is buried beside the altar; we
      see it in the numerous cases where a portion of the victim is eaten
      sacramentally, and the rest burned and scattered over the fields, which it
      is supposed to fertilise. You eat your god in part, so as to imbibe his
      divinity; but you bury <span class="pagenum">326</span><a name="link326"
      id="link326"></a>him in part, so as to secure at the same time his
      fertilising qualities for your corn or your vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit that all this is distinctly mystic; but mystery-mongering and
      strange reduplication of persons, with marvellous identifications and
      minute distinctions, have always formed much of the stock-in-trade of
      religion. If cults were all plain sailing throughout, what room for faith?&mdash;there
      would be less to engage the imagination of the votary.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now let us return awhile to our Mexican instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the annual feast of the great god Tezcatlipoca, which, like most
      similar festivals, fell about the same time as the Christian Easter, a
      young man was chosen to be the representative of the god for a
      twelvemonth. As in the case of almost all chosen victims, he had to be a
      person of unblemished body, and he was trained to behave like a god-king
      with becoming dignity. During his year of godship, he was lapped in
      luxury; and the actual reigning emperor took care that he should be
      splendidly attired, regarding him already as a present deity. He was
      attended by eight pages clad in the royal livery&mdash;which shows him to
      have been a king as well as a god; and wherever he went the people bowed
      down to him. Twenty days before the festival at which he was to be
      sacrificed, four noble maidens, bearing the names of four goddesses, were
      given him to be his brides. The final feast itself, like those of
      Dionysus, of Attis, and of Potraj, occupied five days&mdash;a coincidence
      between the two hemispheres which almost points to original identity of
      custom before the dispersion of the races. During these five days the real
      king remained in his palace&mdash;and this circumstance plainly shows that
      the victim belonged to the common class of substituted and temporary
      divine king-gods. The whole court, on the other hand, attended the victim.
      On the last day of the feast, the victim was ferried across the lake in a
      covered barge to a small temple in the form of a pyramid. On reaching the
      summit, he was seized and held down on a block of stone,&mdash;no doubt
      <span class="pagenum">327</span><a name="link327" id="link327"></a>an
      altar of funereal origin,&mdash;while the priest cut open his breast with
      a stone knife, and plucked his heart out. This he offered to the god of
      the sun. The head was hung up among the skulls of previous victims, no
      doubt for oracular purposes, and as a permanent god; but the legs and arms
      were cooked and prepared for the table of the lords, who thus partook of
      the god sacramentally. His place was immediately filled by another young
      man, who for a year was treated with the same respect, and at the end of
      that time was similarly slaughtered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think I need point out the close resemblance of this ritual to
      that of the Khond Meriah, of the Potraj, and of the festivals of Dionysus,
      Osiris, Attis, and Adonis. But I would also call particular attention to
      the final destination of the skull, and its exact equivalence to the skull
      of the animal-god in India and elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea that the god thus slain in the person of his
      representative comes to life again immediately,&rdquo; says Mr. Frazer,
      &ldquo;was graphically represented in the Mexican ritual by skinning the
      slain man-god, and clothing in his skin a living man, who thus became the
      new representative of the godhead.&rdquo; For example, at an annual
      festival in Mexico, a woman was sacrificed who represented Toci, the
      Mother of the Gods&mdash;a sort of yearly Mexican Cybele. She was dressed
      in the ornaments and bore the name of the goddess of whom she was believed
      to be an incarnation. After being feasted for several days, she was taken
      at midnight to the summit of a temple, and there beheaded. Her body was
      flayed, and one of the priests, clothing himself in the skin, became the
      representative of the goddess Toci. The skin of the woman&rsquo;s thigh,
      however, was separately removed, and a young man who represented the god
      Cinteotl, the son of Toci, wrapt it round him like a mask. Ceremonies then
      followed, in which the two men, clad in the woman&rsquo;s skin, enacted
      the parts of the god and goddess. In all this, there is much that seems to
      me reminiscent <span class="pagenum">328</span><a name="link328"
      id="link328"></a>of Isis and Horus, of Cybele and Attis, of Semele and
      Dionysus, and of several other eastern rituals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more significant is the yearly festival of the god Totec, who was
      represented in like manner by a priest, clad in the skin of a human
      victim, and who received offerings of first-fruits and first-flowers,
      together with bunches of maize which had been kept for seed. Here we have
      the closest possible analogy to the case of the Meriah. The offering of
      first-fruits, made sometimes to the king, sometimes to the ancestral
      spirits, is here made to the human god of cultivation, who represents both
      in his own person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other cannibal sacrifices are recorded in Mexico: in more than one of
      them it was customary for the priest to tear out the warm throbbing heart
      of the victim, and present it to the idol. Whether these sacrifices in
      each particular case were of the ordinary or of the mystic type it is not
      always quite easy to decide; probably the worshippers themselves did not
      accurately discriminate in every instance. But however that may be, we
      know at least this much: when human sacrifices had been rare, the priests
      reminded the kings that the gods &ldquo;were starving with hunger&rdquo;;
      war was then made on purpose to take prisoners, &ldquo;because the gods
      had asked for something to eat,&rdquo; and thousands of victims were thus
      slaughtered annually. The blood of the victims was separately offered; and
      I may add in this connexion that as a rule both ghosts and gods are rather
      thirsty than hungry. I take the explanation of this peculiar taste to be
      that blood and other liquids poured upon the ground of graves or at
      altar-stones soon sink in, and so seem to have been drunk or sucked up by
      the ghost or god; whereas meat and solid offerings are seen to be
      untouched by the deity to whom they are presented. A minor trait in this
      blood-loving habit of the gods is seen in the fact that the Mexicans also
      gave the god to drink fresh blood drawn from their own ears, and that the
      priests likewise drew blood from their legs, and daubed it on the temples.
      Similar mitigations of self-immolation <span class="pagenum">329</span><a
      name="link329" id="link329"></a>are seen elsewhere in the Attis-priest
      drawing blood from his arms for Attis, in the Hebrew Baal-priests &ldquo;cutting
      themselves for Baal,&rdquo; and in the familiar Hebrew rite of
      circumcision. Blood is constantly drawn by survivors or worshippers as an
      act of homage to the dead or to deities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might multiply instances of human sacrifices of the mystic order
      elsewhere, but I prefer to pass on to the various mitigations which they
      tend to undergo in various communities. In its fullest form, I take it,
      the mystic sacrifice ought to be the self-immolation of a divine
      priest-king, a god and descendant of gods, himself to himself, on the
      altar of his own divine foundation-ancestor. But in most cases which we
      can trace, the sacrifice has already assumed the form of an immolation of
      a willing victim, a temporary king, of the divine stock only by adoption,
      though sometimes a son or brother of the actual monarch. Further
      modifications are that the victim becomes a captive taken in war (which
      indeed is implied in the very etymology of the Latin word victima), or a
      condemned criminal, or an imbecile, who can be more readily induced to
      undertake the fatal office. Of all of these we have seen hints at least in
      previous cases. Still more mitigated are the forms in which the victim is
      allowed to escape actual death by a subterfuge, and those in which an
      image or effigy is allowed to do duty for the living person. Of these
      intermediates we get a good instance in the case of the Bhagats, mentioned
      by Col. Dalton, who &ldquo;annually make an image of a man in wood, put
      clothes and ornaments on it, and present it before the altar of a Mahadeo&rdquo;
      (or rude stone phallic idol). &ldquo;The person who officiates as priest
      on the occasion says, &lsquo;O, Mahadeo, we sacrifice this man to you
      according to ancient customs. Give us rain in due season, and a plentiful
      harvest.&rsquo; Then, with one stroke of the axe, the head of the image is
      struck off, and the body is removed and buried.&rdquo; This strange rite
      shows us a surviving <span class="pagenum">330</span><a name="link330"
      id="link330"></a>but much mitigated form of the Khond Meriah practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, however, such bloodless representations do not please the gods;
      nor do they succeed in really liberating a ghost or corn-god. They are
      after all but feeble phantom sacrifices. Blood the gods want, and blood is
      given them. The most common substitute for the human victim-god is
      therefore the animal victim-god, of which we have already seen copious
      examples in the ox and kid of Dionysus, the pig of Attis, and many others.
      It seems probable that a large number of sacrifices, if not the majority
      of those in which domestic animals are slain, belong in the last resort to
      the same category. Thus, indeed, we can most easily explain the theory of
      the so-called &ldquo;thean-thropic&rdquo; victim,&mdash;the animal which
      stands for a man and a god,&mdash;as well as the point of view of
      sacrifice so ably elaborated by Dr. Robertson Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to this theory, the domestic animals were early regarded as of
      the same kin or blood as the tribe; and the slaughter of an ox, a goat, or
      a sheep could only be permitted if it were done, like the slaughter of a
      king&rsquo;s son, sacrificially and sacramentally. In my own opinion, this
      scarcely means more than that the sacred domestic animals were early
      accepted as substitutes for the human victim, and that they were eaten
      sacrificially and sacramentally as the human victim was also eaten. But I
      will waive this somewhat controversial point, and content myself with
      suggesting that the animal victim was habitually treated as in itself
      divine, and that its blood was treated in the same way as the blood of the
      original cannibal offering. At the same time, the sacrifice was usually
      offered at the altar of some older and, so to speak, more constant deity,
      while the blood of the victim was allowed to flow over the sacred stone.
      Certainly, both among the Arabs and the Hebrews, all slaughter of domestic
      animals appears to have been at one time sacrificial; and even when the
      slaughter ceased necessarily to involve a formal sacrifice, it was still
      thought <span class="pagenum">331</span><a name="link331" id="link331"></a>necessary
      to slay the victim in the name of a god, and to pour out the blood in his
      honour on the ground. Even in the Græco-Roman world, the mass of butcher&rsquo;s
      meat was &ldquo;meat offered to idols.&rdquo; We shall see hereafter that
      among existing savages the slaughter of domestic animals is still regarded
      as a sacred rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe also that as a rule the blood-offering is the earliest and
      commonest form of slaughter to the gods; and that the victim in the
      earlier stages was generally consumed by the communicants, as we know the
      cannibal victim to have been consumed among the Mexicans, and as we saw
      the theanthropic goat or kid was orgiastically devoured by the worshippers
      of Dionysus. It is a detail whether the sacred victim happened to be eaten
      raw or cooked; the one usage prevailed in the earlier and more orgiastic
      rites, the other in the milder and more civilised ceremonies. But in
      either case, the animal-god, like the human god, was eaten sacramentally
      by all his worshippers, who thus took into themselves his divine
      qualities. The practice of burning the victim, on the other hand,
      prevailed mainly, I think, among cremationists, like the Tyrians and
      Hellenes, though it undoubtedly extended also to many burying peoples,
      like the Hebrews and Egyptians. In most cases even of cremated victims, it
      would appear, a portion at least of the animal was saved from the fire and
      sacramentally eaten by the worshippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, the victim itself was usually a particular kind of sacred
      animal. This sacredness of the chosen beast has some more important
      bearings than we have yet considered. For among various pastoral races,
      various domesticated animals possess in themselves positive sanctity. We
      know, for example, that cows are very holy in the greater part of India,
      and buffaloes in the Deccan. Among the African peoples of the pastoral
      tribes, the common food is milk and game; cattle are seldom slaughtered
      merely to eat, and always on exceptional or sacred occasions&mdash;the
      very occasions which elsewhere demand a human <span class="pagenum">332</span><a
      name="link332" id="link332"></a>victim&mdash;such as the proclamation of a
      war, a religious festival, a wedding, or the funeral of a great chieftain.
      In such cases, the feast is public, all blood-relations having a natural
      right to attend. The cattle-kraal itself is extremely sacred. The herd and
      its members are treated by their masters with affectionate and almost
      brotherly regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few further points must also be added. Among early races, to kill and
      eat wild animals, or to kill and eat enemies, who are not members of the
      tribe, is not accounted in any way wrong. But to kill a tribesman&mdash;to
      shed kindred blood&mdash;is deeply sinful; and so it is sinful to kill and
      eat the domestic herds. In old age, indeed, or when sick and feeble, you
      may kill and eat your blood-relation blamelessly; and so you may also kill
      and eat old or sickly cattle. But as a rule, you only eat them
      sacramentally and sacrificially, under the same circumstances where you
      would be justified in killing and eating a human victim. Thus, as a rule,
      each tribe has its own sacred beast, which is employed as a regular
      substitute for a man-god. Among the Arabs, this beast was a camel; among
      the Indian peoples, the bull or the buffalo; among shepherd races, it is
      the sheep or goat; among the Teutons, the horse; among many settled urban
      peoples, the pig; and with the Samoyeds and Os-tiaks, their one chattel,
      the reindeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, as a rule, the cow or other female animal was not usually
      sacrificed; she was kept for milk-yielding. It was the bull, the ram, the
      ox, the he-goat that was oftenest offered and eaten sacramentally. Mere
      utilitarian considerations would soon lead to this use, just as our own
      butchers kill ram lambs by choice, and spare the ewes for breeding. The
      custom, once introduced, would tend to become sacred; for whatever our
      divine ancestors did is itself divine, and should not be lightly or
      carelessly altered. Hence we can understand that supreme sanctity of the
      cow, which has made so many races refuse to sacrifice it, while they
      sacrifice and eat the bull or ox without let or scruple. <span
      class="pagenum">333</span><a name="link333" id="link333"></a>Thus the
      Todas have never eaten the flesh of the female buffalo; but the male they
      eat once a year, sacramentally, all the adult men in the village joining
      in the ceremony of killing and roasting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A remarkable instance of the theanthropic sacrifice of such a sacred
      animal is given us in Nilus&rsquo;s account of the ceremony performed by
      the Arabs of his time. A holy camel, chosen as a victim, was bound upon a
      rude cairn of piled-up stones. In this primitive altar we can hardly fail
      to recognise the grave of an early tribal chieftain. The leader of the
      band then led the worshippers thrice round the cairn in a solemn
      procession, chanting a solemn hymn as they went. As the last words of the
      hymn were sung, he fell upon the camel (like Potraj on the lamb), wounded
      it, and hastily drank of the blood that gushed out from it. Forthwith the
      whole company fell on the victim with their swords, hacked off pieces of
      the quivering flesh, and devoured them raw with such wild haste that
      between the rise of the day-star and that of the sun, the entire camel,
      body and bones, skin, blood, and entrails, was absolutely eaten. I need
      not point out the close resemblance of this savage rite to those of Potraj
      and of Dionysus. It is a point, however, to observe that here also the
      blood falls on the cairn or grave or altar. I may note that the annual
      sacrifice of the paschal lamb among the shepherd Hebrews is obviously a
      mere mitigation of this barbarous rite. In that case, as might be expected
      in a more civilised race, the victim is roasted whole: but it is similarly
      necessary that every part of it should be hastily eaten. Legend further
      informs us, in the instance of the Passover, that the lamb was a
      substitute for a human victim, and that the first-born were sanctified to
      Jahweh, instead of being sacrificed. Note also that the feast of the
      paschal lamb occupied the now familiar space of five days: the sacred
      animal was chosen on the tenth day of the month, and sacrificed on the
      fourteenth. The whole ceremonial is most illustrative and full of
      survivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though <span class="pagenum">334</span><a name="link334" id="link334"></a>it
      breaks for a moment the thread of my argument, I find it impossible not to
      mention here the curious parallel case of the judicial sacrifice among the
      Battas of Sumatra, which is the human analogue of the Arabian
      camel-sacrament. Only in this instance, as in so many others, sacrifice
      and punishment merge into one another. &ldquo;With them the adulterer, the
      night-thief, and those who had treacherously attacked a town, a village,
      or a particular person, were condemned to be eaten by the people. They
      were tied to three posts; their legs and their arms were stretched out in
      the shape of a St. Andrew&rsquo;s cross;and then, when a signal was given,
      the populace rushed upon the body and cut it into fragments with hatchets
      or with knives, or perhaps more simply with their nails and their teeth.
      The strips so torn off were devoured instantly, all raw and bloody; they
      were merely dipped into a cocoanut bowl containing a sauce prepared
      beforehand of lemon-juice and salt. In the case of adultery, the outraged
      husband had the right of choosing first what piece he liked best. The
      guests invited to the feast performed this work with so much ardour that
      they often tore and hurt each other.&rdquo; I do not think we can read
      this account without being struck by its close analogy to many of our
      previous sacrifices, both of human corn-gods and of sacred animals. The
      criminal is here nothing more than the substitute for a holy human victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we must also remember that in most countries the gods were
      housemates of their worshippers, present at all times in every home, and
      partakers of every meal, side by side with the living. They lived in the
      house, as still in New Guinea. Libations to them were poured from every
      cup; food was offered to their ghosts or skulls or wooden images at every
      family gathering. The ordinary feasts were thus mere enlarged festal
      gatherings, at which a victim was sacrificially slain and sacramentally
      eaten; and <i>the visitors believed they were eating the body and blood of
      the god to their own salvation</i>. Greater sacrifices, like the <span
      class="pagenum">335</span><a name="link335" id="link335"></a>hecatombs, or
      the heroic Indian horse-sacrifice, must have been relatively rare; but in
      all of them we see clear proof that the victim was regarded as a sacred
      animal, that is to say a god, in one of his embodiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear evidence of this equivalence is seen in the fact that the
      worshippers often clad themselves in the skin of the victim, as the
      Mexicans did in the skin of the annual god. Sometimes the hide is even
      used to deck the idol. In the Cyprian sacrifice of a sheep to the
      sheep-goddess Aphrodite, the celebrants wore the skin of the sheep; while
      the Assyrian Dagon-worshipper offered the fish-sacrifice to the fish-god,
      clad in a fish-skin. Of similar import is doubtless the ægis or goat-skin
      of Athena, envisaged as a goat-goddess, and the skins used in the
      Dionysiac mysteries. I do not hesitate to affiliate all these on a
      primitive usage like that of the Mexican cannibal sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached this point, we can see further that the case where a sacred
      animal, the representative of a human victim, is slaughtered before the
      altar of an older god is exactly equivalent to the other known case where
      a human victim is slaughtered before the foundation-stone of a town or
      village. In either case, there is a distinct renewal of the divine life;
      fresh blood, as it were, is instilled by the act into the ancient deity.
      All the other concomitants are precisely the same. Thus at the Theban
      sacrifice of a ram to the ram-god Amen, the worshippers bewailed the
      victim, as the women bewailed Adonis and Attis; and the image of Amen was
      finally draped in the skin of the victim, while its body was buried in a
      sacred coffin. At the Buphonia or sacramental ox-slaying in Athens, there
      was a regular trial after the victim was slain, everybody throwing the
      blame on one another, till at last the knife that inflicted the wound was
      found guilty of murder and cast into the sea. (This casting into the sea
      of a guilt-bearer for the community will meet us again when we come to
      consider the doctrine of the atonement.) So we saw that the Potraj fled
      after the performance of his sanguinary sacrifice; and <span
      class="pagenum">336</span><a name="link336" id="link336"></a>so too the
      slayer of the Dionysus-calf at Tenedos fled for his life when the ceremony
      was completed. Indeed, we get many intermediate cases, like that of the
      goat dressed up as a girl which was offered theanthropically to Artemis
      Munychia, or that of the Dionysus-calf clad in buskins, whose mother-cow
      was treated as a woman in child-birth. To me, all these instances are
      obvious attempts to palm off, as it were, on the gods a sacred animal in
      place of a genuine human victim. They are little more than divine legal
      fictions, eked out, no doubt, by the fiction of kinship between the herd
      and its masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a whole, then, we may venture to say not perhaps that all, but that a
      great number of sacrifices, and certainly the best-known among historic
      nations, are slaughters of animal substitutes for human victims; and that
      the flesh is sacramentally consumed by the worshippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one special form of this animal sacrifice, however, which I
      cannot here pass over in complete silence. It is the one of which the
      harvest-feast is the final relic. Mr. Frazer has fully worked out this
      theme in his fascinating essay: to detail it here at length would occupy
      too much space; I can only give the barest outline of his instances.
      Originally, it would seem, the corn-god or corn-spirit was conceived
      during the reaping as taking refuge in the last sheaf left standing.
      Whoever cut that wisp of corn slew the corn-spirit, and was therefore, on
      the analogy of the slayer of the divine king, himself the corn-spirit. Mr.
      Frazer does not absolutely assert that this human representative was
      originally killed and eaten, though all analogy would seem to suggest it;
      but that he was at least killed is abundantly certain; and killed he still
      is, in dumb show at any rate, on many modern European corn-fields. More
      often, however, the corn-spirit is supposed to be embodied in any animal
      which happens to be found in the last sheaf, where even now small
      creatures like mice and hedgehogs often take refuge. In earlier times,
      however, wolves, wild boars, and other large animals <span class="pagenum">337</span><a
      name="link337" id="link337"></a>seem to have been frequently met with
      under similar circumstances. However that may be, a great many beasts&mdash;generally
      sacred beasts&mdash;are or have been sacramentally eaten as
      representatives of the corn-god; while, conversely, the last sheaf is
      often made up into the image of a man or still more often of a woman, and
      preserved religiously for a year, like the annual king, till the next
      harvest. Sometimes a cock is beheaded and eaten at the harvest feast,
      special importance being here attached to its head, as to the head of the
      human victim in so many other cases. Sometimes, as with the ancient
      Prussians, it was the corn-goat whose body was sacramentally eaten.
      Sometimes, as at Chambéry, an ox is slaughtered, and eaten with special
      rites by the reapers at supper. Sometimes, it is the old sacred Teutonic
      animal, the horse, that is believed to inhabit the last wisp of corn. I
      will add parenthetically here (what I trust in some future work to show)
      that we have probably in this and kindred ideas the origin of the sacred
      and oracular heads of horses and oxen attached to temples or built into
      churches. Sometimes, again, it is a pig that represents the god, and is
      ceremonially eaten at the harvest festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need hardly mention that all these sacred animals, substitutes for the
      original human god, find their parallels in the festivals of Dionysus,
      Attis, Osiris, Demeter, Adonis, Lityerses, and the other great corn and
      wine gods of the historic civilisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is yet another and more sublimated form of sacramental feast.
      Since the corn-god and the wine-god, when slain, undergo resurrection in
      the corn and the vine, may we not also eat their bodies as bread, and
      drink their blood as wine or soma?
    </p>
    <p>
      To people already familiar, first with the honorific cannibal form of
      god-eating, and then with its gentler animal-victim modification, nothing
      could be more natural than this slight transference of feeling. Nay, more:
      <i>whoever eat bread and drank wine from the beginning must have known
      <span class="pagenum">338</span><a name="link338" id="link338"></a>it was
      the body and blood of a god he was eating and drinking</i>. Still, there
      is a certain difference between mere ordinary every-day food and the
      sacramental feast, to which sacred cannibalism and animal-sacrifice had
      now familiarised men&rsquo;s minds. Accordingly, we find in many cases
      that there exists a special <i>sacramental</i> eating and drinking of
      bread and wine, which is more especially regarded as <i>eating the body
      and drinking the blood of the deity</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some curious illustrative facts may here be cited. Since straw and corn
      grow from the slaughtered corn-god, they may be regarded as one of his
      natural embodiments. Hence, when human sacrifices are prohibited, people
      sometimes make a straw god do duty for a human one. The Gonds, we saw,
      used once to kidnap sacred Brahman boys&mdash;gods by race, as it were,
      yet strangers and children&mdash;scatter their blood over the fields, and
      eat their bodies sacramentally. But when the unsympathetic British
      government interfered with the god-making habits of the Gond people, they
      took, says Col. Dalton, to making an image of straw instead, which they
      now similarly sacrifice. So it may be noted in many of the ceremonies of
      &ldquo;Burying the Carnival&rdquo; and the like, which I have already
      cited, that a straw man is substituted symbolically for the human victim.
      Indeed, in that singular set of survivals we have every possible
      substitute&mdash;the mock king, the imbecile, the pretended killing, the
      ceremonial shedding of blood, the animal victim, and the straw man or
      effigy. I may add that even the making of our modern Guy Fawkes as &ldquo;a
      man of straw&rdquo; is thus no mere accident. But we get a very similar
      use of corn in the curious practice of fashioning the corn-wife and the
      corn-baby, so fully detailed by Mr. Frazer. In this attenuated survival of
      human sacrifice, a sheaf of corn does duty for a human victim, and
      represents the life of the corn-god or corn-spirit from one year to
      another. All the existing evidence goes to suggest the idea that at
      harvest a corn-maiden or corn-wife, after a year <span class="pagenum">339</span><a
      name="link339" id="link339"></a>of deification, was slain in former times,
      and that the human victim is now represented by her vegetable analogue or
      equivalent, the corn in the ear, a sheaf of which does duty in her place,
      and reigns as corn-queen till the next year&rsquo;s harvest. The corn-baby
      is thus a temporary queen, made of corn, not of human flesh and blood. We
      may compare with this case the account of the Sioux girl who was
      sacrificed by the Pawnees, by being burned over a slow fire, and then shot
      (like St. Sebastian) with arrows. The chief sacrificer tore out her heart
      and devoured it, thus eating the goddess in true cannibal fashion. While
      her flesh was still warm, it was cut up into small pieces and taken to the
      corn-field. Drops of blood were squeezed from it upon the grains of
      seed-corn; after which it was all covered up in the ground to form a
      crop-raiser. Of such a ghastly goddess-making ceremony, our seemingly
      innocent harvest comedy of the corn-baby is probably the last surviving
      relic. Mr. Frazer rightly connects it with the cult of the Athenian Korê,
      Persephone. I think, indeed, the double form of the name, &ldquo;the Old
      Woman&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Corn-baby,&rdquo; makes it probable that the
      pair are the vegetable equivalents of both Demeter and her ravished
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other cases, however, it is the actual bread and wine themselves, not
      the straw or the corn in the ear, that represent the god and are
      sacramentally eaten. We owe to Mr. Frazer most of our existing knowledge
      of the wide prevalence and religious importance of this singular ritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen already that in many countries the first-fruits of the crops
      are presented either to ancestral ghosts, or to the great gods, or else to
      the king, who is the living god and present representative of the divine
      ancestors. Till this is done, it would be unsafe to eat of the new
      harvest. The god within it would kill you. But in addition to the
      ceremonial offering of first-fruits to the spirits, many races also
      &ldquo;eat the god&rdquo; in the new corn or rice sacramentally. In
      Wermland, in Sweden, the farmer&rsquo;s wife uses <span class="pagenum">340</span><a
      name="link340" id="link340"></a>the grain of the last sheaf (in which, as
      we saw, the corn-god or corn-spirit is supposed specially to reside), in
      order to bake a loaf in the shape of a little girl. Here we have the
      maiden, who was previously sacrificed as a corn-goddess or Persephone,
      reappearing once more in a bread image. This loaf is divided among all the
      household and eaten by them. So at La Palisse in France, a man made of
      dough is hung upon the fir-tree which is carried home to the granary on
      the last harvest-waggon. The dough man and the tree are taken to the mayor&rsquo;s
      house till the vintage is over; then a feast takes place, at which the
      mayor breaks the dough man in pieces, and gives the fragments to the
      people to eat. Here, the mayor clearly represents the king or chief, while
      the feast of first-fruits and the sacramental eating are combined, as was
      perhaps originally the case, in one and the same sacrificial ceremony. No
      particular mention is made of wine; but as the feast is deferred so as to
      take place after the vintage, it is probable that the blood of the
      wine-god as well as the body of the corn-god entered once at least into
      the primitive ritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many similar feasts survive in Europe; but for the rite of eating the
      corn-god in its fullest form we must go once more to Mexico, which also
      supplied us with the best and most thoroughly characteristic examples of
      the cannibal god-eating. Twice a year, in May and December, an image of
      the great Mexican god Huitzilopochtli was made of dough, then broken in
      pieces, and solemnly eaten by his assembled worshippers. Two days before
      the May feast, says Acosta, the virgins of the temple kneaded beet-seeds
      with roasted maize, and moulded them with honey into a paste idol, as big
      as the permanent wooden idol which represented the god, putting in glass
      beads for eyes, and grains of Indian corn in the place of teeth. The
      nobles then brought the vegetable god an exquisite and rich garment, like
      that worn by the wooden idol, and dressed the image up in it. This done,
      the carried the effigy on a litter <span class="pagenum">341</span><a
      name="link341" id="link341"></a>on their shoulders, no doubt to mark its
      royal authority. On the morning of the feast, the virgins of the god
      dressed themselves in garlands of maize and other festal attire. Young
      men, similarly caparisoned, carried the image in its ark or litter to the
      foot of the great pyramid temple. It was <i>drawn up the steps with
      clanging music of flutes and trumpets&mdash;a common accompaniment of
      god-slaying ceremonies</i>. Flowers were strewed on it, as was usual with
      all the gods of vegetation, and it was lodged in a little chapel of roses.
      Certain ceremonies of singing and dancing then took place, by means of
      which the paste was consecrated into the actual body and bones of the god.
      Finally, the image was broken up and distributed to the people, first the
      nobles, and then the commonalty, who received it, men, women, and
      children, &ldquo;with such tears, fear, and reverence as if it were
      sacred, saying they did eat the flesh and bones of God, wherewith they
      were grieved.&rdquo; I need not point out the close resemblance here to
      the mourning over the bodies of Attis and Adonis, nor to the rites of
      Dionysus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more closely does the December feast (which took place, like
      Christmas, at the winter solstice) recall the cannibal practice; for here
      an image of the god was made of seeds, kneaded into dough with the blood
      of children. Such a Massacre of the Innocents occurs often elsewhere in
      similar connexions: we shall meet with it again on a subsequent occasion.
      The image was placed on the chief altar of the temple, and on the day of
      its Epiphany, the king of Mexico offered incense to it. Bambino gods like
      this are well known in other countries. Next day it was taken down, and a
      priest flung at it a flint-tipped arrow. This was called &ldquo;killing
      the god so that his body might be eaten.&rdquo; One of the priests then
      cut out the heart of the image and gave it to the actual king to eat, just
      as in other sacrifices the priest cut out the throbbing heart of the human
      victim and placed it in the mouth of the cannibal god. The rest of the
      image was divided into small pieces, <span class="pagenum">342</span><a
      name="link342" id="link342"></a>which were distributed to all the males of
      the community, adults or children. The ceremony was called &ldquo;<i>God
      is Eaten</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not multiply examples of the main principle of eating the corn-god
      in the shape of little cakes or human images, which have been collected in
      abundance all the world over. Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s work is a perfect
      thesaurus of analogous customs. I will rather call attention to one or two
      special parallels with similar god-eating rites, cannibal or animal, which
      occur elsewhere. At the close of the rice harvest in Boeroe, in the East
      Indies, each clan meets at a common sacrificial meal, to which every
      member of the clan is bound to contribute a little of his new rice from
      the current season. This is called &ldquo;eating the soul of the rice.&rdquo;
      But some of the rice is also set apart and offered to the spirits&mdash;that
      is, I take it, to the ghosts of ancestors. This combination is like the
      common case of the human victim being offered on the altar-stone of
      earlier ancestral deities. Amongst the Alfoers of Celebes, again, it is
      the priest who sows the first rice-seeds, and plucks the first ripe rice
      in each field. This he roasts and grinds into meal, giving some of it to
      each member of the family. Here the priest no doubt represents the old
      tribal priest-king. Several similar practices are reported from India,
      only one of which need at present detain us. Among the Hindoos of the
      Deccan there is a magical and sacramental eating of the new rice; but the
      special point of interest to be noted here is the fact that some of it is
      offered to the god Ganesa, after which the whole family partake of the
      produce. Among the Kafirs of Natal and Zululand, however, it is at the
      king&rsquo;s kraal that the people assemble for their sacramental feast of
      new fruits, where they dance and perform certain sacred ceremonies. In
      this case, the king, the living god, seems to take the place of the god,
      the dead king, in the Indian festival. Various grains are mixed with the
      flesh of a sacrificed animal, in whom we shall now have perhaps little
      difficulty in recognising the representative <span class="pagenum">343</span><a
      name="link343" id="link343"></a>of a human corn-god victim; and <i>a
      portion of this mess is placed in the mouth of each man by the king
      himself, here officiating in his capacity of ancestral priest</i>. By the
      light of such analogies, I think we need have no hesitation in
      reconstructing the primitive sacramental feast, where a man was sacrificed
      as an annual manufactured corn-god; seeds were mixed with his blood; his
      flesh was eaten sacramentally by the people, fed by the king; a part of
      his body was also eaten by the king himself, and a part was offered to the
      great gods, or to the tribal god, or the foundation god or goddess of the
      village or city. After putting together the various survivals already
      cited, I do not think this is too large an exercise of the constructive
      faculty.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting mixed case of god-eating, in which the cake was baked, not
      in the form of a man, but of a divine animal, I have seen myself in the
      house of Irish emigrants in Canada. The new corn was there made into
      loaves or buns in the shape of little pigs, with currants for eyes; and
      one of these was given to each of the children. Though merely regarded as
      a playful custom, this instance, I venture to think, has still its own
      illustrative value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practice of kneading sacramental cakes from the blood of infants,
      which we saw to prevail in the case of a Mexican god, is parallelled in
      the practice of mixing them with shreds of the flesh from an animal victim
      in the Zulu ceremony. The cannibal form of the rite must, however, have
      been very widespread; as we gather from the fact that a Christian sect,
      the Paulicians, were accused of it as late as the eighth century. John of
      Osun, Patriarch of Armenia, wrote a diatribe against these sectaries, in
      which he mentions the fact that they moulded an image of wheaten flower
      with the blood of children, and eat therewith their unholy communion. Of
      course, there could have been no direct intercourse in the ninth century
      between Armenia and Mexico; but the accusation shows at least that similar
      ceremonies were known or remembered in <span class="pagenum">344</span><a
      name="link344" id="link344"></a>Asia as actual practices. Indeed, the
      Harranians in the middle ages annually sacrificed an infant, and boiling
      down its flesh, baked it into cakes, of which every freeman was allowed to
      partake. In both these cases, we have the two extremes of eating the god
      combined in one practice&mdash;the cannibal rite and the sacramental
      corn-cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frazer calls attention to another interesting transitional instance.
      Loaves made in the shape of men were called at Rome Maniæ; and it appears
      that such loaves were specially made at Aricia. Now Aricia was also the
      one place in Italy where a divine priest-king, the Rex Nemoralis, lived on
      well recognised into the full blaze of the historic period, on the old
      savage tenure of killing his predecessor. Again, Mania was the name of the
      Mother or Grandmother of Ghosts. Woollen images, dedicated to this Latin
      Cybele, were hung out in Rome at the feast of the Compitalia, and were
      said to be substitutes for human victims. Mr. Frazer suggests that the
      loaves in human form which were baked at Aricia were sacramental bread;
      and that in old days, when the Rex Nemoralis was annually slain, loaves
      were also made in his image as in Mexico, and were eaten sacramentally by
      his worshippers. I do not hesitate myself to suggest still further that
      the <i>gingerbread cakes, shaped like a man</i>, and still richly gilt,
      which are sold at so many fairs in France and Italy, and also sometimes in
      England, are last dying relics of similar early sacramental images. For
      fairs are for the most part diminished survivals of religious festivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the theanthropic animal victim represents a man and a god, it is
      reasonable that a cake shaped as an animal and baked of flour should
      sometimes do as well as the animal victim. For the corn is after all the
      embodiment of the corn-god. Hence bakers in the antique world used to keep
      in stock representations in dough of the various sacrificial animals, for
      people who were too poor to afford the originals. Oxen and sheep were
      regularly so represented. When Mithridates besieged Cyzicus, and the
      people <span class="pagenum">345</span><a name="link345" id="link345"></a>could
      not get a black cow to sacrifice to Persephone, they made a dough cow and
      placed it at the altar. At the Athenian festival of the Diasia, cakes
      shaped like animals were similarly sacrificed; and at the Osiris festival
      in Egypt, when the rich offered a real pig, the poor used to present a
      dough pig as a substitute, like the dough pig of the Irish Canadians.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in many other rites, the sacramental and sacrificial cake has entirely
      lost all semblance of a man or animal. The god is then eaten either in the
      shapeless form of a boiled mess of rice or porridge, or in a round cake or
      loaf, without image of any sort, or in a wafer stamped with the solar or
      Christian cross. Instances of this type are familiar to everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      More closely related still to primitive cannibalism is the curious ritual
      of the Sin-Eater, so well elaborated by Mr. Sidney Hartland. In Upper
      Bavaria, what is called a corpse-cake is kneaded from flour, and placed on
      the breast of a dead person, in order to absorb the virtues of the
      departed. This cake is then eaten by the nearest relation. In the Balkan
      peninsula, a small image of the dead person was made in bread and eaten by
      the survivors of the family. These are intermediate stages between
      cannibalism and the well-known practice of sin-eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope I have now made clear the general affiliation which I am seeking to
      suggest, if not to establish. My idea is that in the beginning certain
      races devoured their own parents, or parts of them, so as to absorb the
      divine souls of their forebears into their own bodies. Later, when
      artificial god-making became a frequent usage, especially in connexion
      with agriculture, men eat the god, or part of him, for a similar reason.
      But they likewise eat him as the corn or yam or rice, sacramentally. When
      thean-thropic victims were substituted for the man-god, they eat the
      theanthropic victim in like manner. Also they made images in paste of both
      man and beast, and, treating these as compounded of the god, similarly
      sacrificed and eat them. <span class="pagenum">346</span><a name="link346"
      id="link346"></a>And they drank his blood, in the south as wine, in the
      north as beer, in India as soma. If this line of reconstruction be
      approximately correct, then sacraments as a whole are in the last resort
      based upon survival from the cannibal god-feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>It is a significant fact that in many cases, as at the Potraj festival,
      the officiating priest drinks the blood of the divine victim, while the
      laity are only permitted to eat of its body</i>.

      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;THE DOCTRINE OF THE ATONEMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE <span
      class="pagenum">347</span><a name="link347" id="link347"></a>more element
      of some importance yet remains in the complex conception of the human or
      animal victim, or slain god, which we must briefly examine before we can
      proceed with advantage to the evolution of Christianity; I mean the
      doctrine of piacular sacrifice&mdash;or, in other words, of the atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Without shedding of blood,&rdquo; says the author of one of the
      earliest Christian tractates, &ldquo;there is no remission of sin</i>.&rdquo;
      This is a common theory in all advanced religions; the sacrifice is
      regarded, not merely as the self-immolation of a willing divine victim or
      incarnate god, but also as an expiation for crimes committed. &ldquo;<i>Behold
      the Lamb of God,&rdquo; says the Baptist in the legend, &ldquo;which
      taketh away the sins of the world</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea, I take it, is not primitive. Sin must be regarded as a late
      ethical intruder into the domain of religion. Early man for the most part
      takes his gods joyously. He is on the best of terms with them. He eats and
      drinks and carouses in their presence. They join in his phallic and
      bacchanalian orgies. They are not great moral censors, like the noble
      creation of the Hebrew prophets, &ldquo;of purer eyes than to behold
      iniquity.&rdquo; They are creatures of like passions and failings with
      himself,&mdash;dear ancestors and friends, ever ready to overlook small
      human frailties like murder or rapine, but exercising a fatherly care for
      the most part over the lives and fortunes of their descendants or
      tribesmen. Angry they may be at times, <span class="pagenum">348</span><a
      name="link348" id="link348"></a>no doubt; but their anger as a rule can be
      easily assuaged by a human victim, or by the blood of slaughtered goats
      and bulls. Under normal circumstances, they are familiar housemates. Their
      skulls or images adorn the hearth. They assist at the family and domestic
      feasts; and they lick up the offerings of blood or wine made to them with
      a smiling countenance. In short, they are average members of the tribe,
      gone before to the spirit-world; and they continue to share without pride
      or asceticism in the joys and feasts and merry-makings of their relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the idea of expiation, save as a passing appeasement for a temporary
      tiff, did not probably occur in the very earliest and most primitive
      religions. It is only later, as ethical ideas begin to obtrude themselves
      into the sacred cycle, that the notion of sin, which is primarily that of
      an offence against the established etiquette of the gods, makes itself
      slowly visible. In many cases, later glosses seem to put a piacular sense
      upon what was in its origin by obvious analogy a mere practical god-making
      and godslaying ceremony. But in more consciously philosophic stages of
      religion this idea of atonement gains ground so fast that it almost
      swallows up the earlier conception of communion or feasting together.
      Sacrifice is then chiefly conceived of as a piacular offering to a justly
      offended or estranged deity; this is the form of belief which we find
      almost everywhere meeting us in the hecatombs of the Homeric poems, as in
      many works of Hellenic and Semitic literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, the piacular sacrifice seems to have crystallised and
      solidified round the sacred person of the artificial deity. &ldquo;The
      accumulated misfortunes and sins of the whole people,&rdquo; says Mr.
      Frazer, &ldquo;are sometimes laid upon the dying god, who is supposed to
      bear them away for ever, leaving the people innocent and happy.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows,&rdquo;
      says one of the Hebrew poets, whose verses are conjecturally attributed
      <span class="pagenum">349</span><a name="link349" id="link349"></a>to
      Isaiah, about one such divine scapegoat; &ldquo;yet we did esteem him
      stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. He was wounded for our
      transgressions; he was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our
      peace was upon him, and with his stripes are we healed. Jahweh hath laid
      upon him the iniquity of us all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ideas here expressed in such noble language were common to all the
      later man-gods of the more advanced and ethical religions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frazer is probably right in connecting the notion of the scapegoat,
      human or animal, with <i>the popular barbaric idea of the transference of
      evils</i>. Thus, in popular magic of all nations, diseases of every sort,
      from serious fevers and plagues, down to headache, toothache, warts, and
      sores, are transferred by some simple ceremony of witchcraft to animals,
      rags, or other people. I will quote examples but briefly. Epilepsy is made
      over to leaves and thrown away in the Malay Archipelago. Toothache is put
      into a stone in Australia. A Bechuana king gave his illness to an ox,
      which was drowned in his stead, to secure his recovery. Mr. Gomme quotes a
      terrible story of a Scotch nobleman who transferred his mortal disease to
      his brother by a magical ceremony. &ldquo;Charms&rdquo; for fever or for
      warts generally contain some such amiable element of transferring the
      trouble to a string, a rag, or a piece of paper, which is flung away to
      carry the evil with it to the person who next touches it. Numerous cases
      of like implication may be found in the works of Mr. Gomme and Mr.
      Hartland, to which I would refer enquirers after further evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closely connected with these notions of transference are also the
      occasional or periodical ceremonies undertaken for the expulsion of evils
      from a village or a community. Devils, demons, hostile spirits, diseases,
      and other misfortunes of every sort are frequently thus expelled with
      gongs, drums, and other magical instruments. Often the boundaries of the
      tribe or parish are gone over, a <span class="pagenum">350</span><a
      name="link350" id="link350"></a>perlustration is performed, and the evil
      influences are washed out of the territory or forcibly ejected. Our own
      rite of Beating the Bounds represents on one of its many sides this
      primitive ceremony. Washings and dippings are frequent accompaniments of
      the expulsive ritual; in Peru, it was also bound up with that common
      feature of the corn-god sacrament&mdash;a cake kneaded with the blood of
      living children. The periodical exorcism generally takes place once a
      year, but is sometimes biennial: it has obvious relations with the
      sacrifice of the human or animal victim. In Europe, it still survives in
      many places as the yearly expulsion of witches. The whole subject has been
      so admirably treated by Mr. Frazer that I have nothing to add to his
      excellent exposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting these two cardinal ideas together, we arrive at the compound
      conception of the <i>scapegoat</i>. A scapegoat is a human or animal
      victim, chosen to carry off, at first the misfortunes or diseases, later
      the sin and guilt of the community. The name by which we designate it in
      English, being taken from the derivative Hebrew usage, has animal
      implications; but, as in all analogous cases, I do not doubt that the
      human evil-bearer precedes the animal one.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good example of this incipient stage in the evolution of the scapegoat
      occurs at Onitsha, on the Quorra River. Two human beings are there
      annually sacrificed, &ldquo;to take away the sins of the land&rdquo;&mdash;though
      I suspect it would be more true to native ideas to say, &ldquo;the
      misfortunes.&rdquo; The number two, as applied to the victims, crops up
      frequently in this special connexion. The victims here again are &ldquo;bought
      with a price&rdquo;&mdash;purchased by public subscription. All persons
      who during the previous year have committed gross offences against native
      ethics are expected to contribute to the cost of the victims. Two sickly
      people are bought with the money, &ldquo;one for the land and one for the
      river.&rdquo; The victims are dragged along the ground to the place of
      execution, face downward. The crowd who accompany <span class="pagenum">351</span><a
      name="link351" id="link351"></a>them cry, &ldquo;Wickedness! wickedness!&rdquo;
      So in Siam it was customary to choose a broken-down woman of evil life,
      carry her on a litter through the streets (which is usually a symbol of
      kingship or godhead) and throw her on a dunghill or hedge of thorns
      outside the wall, forbidding her ever again to enter the city. In this
      eastern case, there is mere expulsion, not actual killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other instances, however, the divine character attributed to the human
      scapegoat is quite unmistakable. Among the Gonds of India, at the festival
      of the god of the crops, the deity descends on the head of one of the
      worshippers, who is seized with a fit, and rushes off to the jungle.
      There, it is believed he would die of himself, if he were not brought back
      and tenderly treated: but the Gonds, more merciful here than in many other
      cases, take him back and restore him. The idea is that he is thus singled
      out to bear the sins of the rest of the village. At Halberstadt in
      Thuringia an exactly similar custom survived till late in the middle ages.
      A man was chosen, stained with deadly sin, as the public scapegoat. On the
      first day of Lent he was dressed in mourning, and expelled from church.
      For forty days, he wandered about, fed only by the priests, and no one
      would speak to him. He slept in the street. On the day before Good Friday,
      however, he was absolved of his sins, and being called Adam, was believed
      to be now in a state of innocence. This is a mitigated and Christianised
      form of the human sin-offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the Albanians of the Eastern Caucasus kept a number of sacred
      slaves in the temple of the moon, many of whom were inspired and
      prophesied. When one of these men exhibited unusual symptoms of
      inspiration, the high priest had him bound with a sacred chain, and
      maintained for a year in luxury, like the Mexican corn-god. This fact
      immediately brings the human scapegoat into line with the annual human
      gods we have already considered. At the end of a year, he was anointed
      with unguents (or, so to speak, christed), and led forth to be sacrificed.
      <span class="pagenum">352</span><a name="link352" id="link352"></a>The
      sacrifice was accomplished as a purificatory ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frazer, to whom I owe all these examples, connects with such rites the
      curious ceremony of the expulsion of the Old Mars, the Mamurius Veturius,
      at Rome. Every year on the 14th of March (near the spring equinox), a man,
      called by the name of a god, was clad in skins&mdash;the significance of
      which rite we now know&mdash;and after being beaten with long white rods,
      was expelled the city. From one point of view, this personage no doubt
      represented the god of vegetation of the previous year (for the Mars was
      originally an annual corn-god). But from another point of view, being now
      of no further use to the community, he was utilised with true old Roman
      parsimony as a scapegoat, and sent to carry away the offences of the
      people. Indeed, there seems to be some reason for believing that he was
      driven into the territory of the hostile Oscans. In this case we perceive
      that an annual god is made the sin-offering for the crimes of a nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Greece, we get similar traces of the human scapegoat. At Chæronea in
      Boeotia, the chief magistrate at the town-hall, and every householder in
      his own house, as we learn from Plutarch (who was himself a magistrate
      there) had on a certain day to beat a slave with rods of <i>agnus castus</i>,
      and turn him out of doors, with the formula, &ldquo;Out, hunger! in,
      health and wealth!&rdquo; Elsewhere the custom retained more unpleasant
      features. At Marseilles, when the colony was ravaged by plague, a man of
      the poorer classes used voluntarily to offer himself as a sin-offering or
      scapegoat. Here we have once more the common episode of the willing
      victim. For a whole year, like other annual gods, he was fed at the public
      expense, and treated as a gentleman&mdash;that is to say, a kingly
      man-god. At the end of that time, he was dressed in sacred garments
      &mdash;another mark of godship&mdash;decked with holy branches, the common
      insignia of gods of vegetation, and led through the city, while prayers
      were offered up that the sins of <span class="pagenum">353</span><a
      name="link353" id="link353"></a>the people might fall on his head. He was
      then cast out of the colony. The Athenians kept a number of outcasts as
      public victims at the expense of the town; and when plague, drought, or
      famine befell, sacrificed two of them (note the number) as human
      scapegoats. One was said to be a substitute for the men, and one for the
      women. They were led about the city (like Beating the Bounds again) and
      then apparently stoned to death without it. Moreover, periodically every
      year, at the festival of the Thargelia, two victims were stoned to death
      as scapegoats at Athens, one for the men, and one for the women. I would
      conjecturally venture to connect this sacred number, not merely with the
      African practice already noted, but also with the dual kings at Sparta,
      the two consuls at Rome, and the two suffetes at Carthage and in other
      Semitic cities. The duality of kings, indeed, is a frequent phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can only add here that the many other ceremonies connected with these
      human scapegoats have been well expounded and explained by Mannhardt, who
      shows that they were all of a purificatory character, and that the
      scourging of the god before putting him to death was a necessary point of
      divine procedure. Hence the significance of the <i>agnus castus</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly, then, the evidence collected by Mannhardt and Frazer suffices to
      suggest that the human scapegoat was the last term of a god, condemned to
      death, upon whose head the transgression or misfortunes of the community
      were laid as substitute. He was the vicarious offering who died for the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only here and there, however, that the scapegoat retains to
      historical times his first early form as a human victim. Much more often,
      in civilised lands at least, we get the usual successive mitigations of
      the custom. Sometimes, as we have seen already in these cases, the victim
      is not actually killed, but merely expelled, or even only playfully and
      ceremonially driven out of the city. In other instances, <span
      class="pagenum">354</span><a name="link354" id="link354"></a>we get the
      familiar substitution of the condemned criminal, or the imbecile, as in
      the Attic Thargelia.&rsquo; The Greeks of Asia Minor used actually to burn
      their atonement-victim, and cast his ashes into the sea; but the
      Leucadians merely threw down a condemned prisoner from a cliff, and
      lightened his fall by fastening live birds to him, while they kept boats
      below to save him from drowning, and carry him well beyond the frontier.
      In the vast majority of cases, however, we have the still more common
      substitution of a sacred animal for a human victim; and this appears to be
      in large part the origin of that common religious feature, the piacular
      sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally we get historical or half-historical evidence of the
      transition from a human victim to a divine or quasidivine animal. Thus,
      the people of Nias offer either a red horse or a buffalo to purify the
      land; but formerly, a man was bound to the same stake with the buffalo,
      and when the buffalo was killed, the man was driven away, no native daring
      to receive him or feed him. The sacrificial camel of the ancient Arabs,
      presumably piacular, is expressly stated to be a substitute for a human
      victim. The favourite victims of the Saracens were young and beautiful
      captives: but if such were not to be procured, they contented themselves
      with a white and faultless camel. The step hence to the habitual
      immolation or driving forth of a divine animal in place of a divine or
      quasi-divine man is a very small one. In Malabar, the cow is a sacred
      beast, and to kill or eat a cow is a crime like murder. Nevertheless, the
      Brahmans transfer the sins of the people to a cow or cows, which are then
      driven out wherever the Brahmans appoint. The ancient Egyptians used to
      sacrifice a bull, and lay upon its head all the evils which might
      otherwise happen to themselves and their country; then they sold the bull&rsquo;s
      head to the Greeks, or flung it into the river. (Contrast this effort to
      get rid of the accursed head with the careful preservation and worship of
      the sacred one.) The best-known case of all, of course, is the Hebrew
      scapegoat, which was <span class="pagenum">355</span><a name="link355"
      id="link355"></a>the sacred animal of a shepherd people, turned out to die
      of hunger or thirst in the desert, and bearing on its head the sins of the
      people. (Contrast the scapegoat with the paschal lamb, and compare with
      the goats and sheep of the last judgment.) When cholera rages among the
      aboriginal tribes of India, they take a goat or a buffalo&mdash;in either
      case a female, the most sacred sex in Indian sacrifice, and black all
      over, like Apis and Mnevis; they turn it out of the village, with magical
      ceremonies, and do not allow it to return within their precincts. In many
      other similar poojahs, the victim is a goat. Mr. Frazer has collected,
      here as elsewhere, a vast number of valuable and illustrative instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, the man-god or divine animal selected as a scapegoat is not
      actually slaughtered, in the fullest form of the rite; he is driven away,
      or flung into the sea, or left to die of hunger and thirst. Sometimes,
      however, he is burned as a holocaust: sometimes he is stoned, and
      sometimes slaughtered. And in later and less perfect forms of piacular
      animal sacrifice, slaughter was the rule, save where burning had ousted
      it. Indeed, in many cases, it is difficult to disentangle the various
      elements of the complex problem. People had got accustomed to certain
      forms of sacrifice, and mixed them up indiscriminately, so that one and
      the same rite seems sometimes to be sacramental, sacrificial, and
      piacular, all at once. Thus Dr. Robertson Smith writes of ancient Egypt:
      &ldquo;Bulls were offered on the altar, and part of the flesh eaten in a
      sacrificial feast; but the sacrifice was only permitted as a piaculum, was
      preceded by a solemn fast, and was accompanied by public lamentation, as
      at the death of a kinsman.&rdquo; Compare the annual mourning for Adonis;
      and also the similar union of sacrifice, sacrament, and atonement in the
      Mass, which, at the great resurrection-festival of the Christian year,
      Easter, is equally preceded by a fast, and by the solemn mourning of Good
      Friday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I do not pretend to discriminate accurately in these <span
      class="pagenum">356</span><a name="link356" id="link356"></a>very mixed
      cases between one element and another in the compound rite. Often enough,
      all the various traits of god-slaying, of sacrament, and of public
      expiation are evidently present. Usually, too, the victim is slain before
      the altar or sacred stone of some earlier and greater god, and its blood
      poured forth for him. Thus, in the Hebrew ritual both of the holocaust and
      the sin-offering, the victim is slain at the altar, &ldquo;before Jahweh,&rdquo;
      and the effusion of blood on the sacred slab has a special significance.
      In the Semitic held, as Dr. Robertson Smith observes (and I would add, in
      most others), &ldquo;<i>the fundamental idea of sacrifice is not that of a
      sacred tribute, but of joint communion between the god and his
      worshippers, by joint participation in the living flesh and blood of a
      sacred victim</i>.&rdquo; But the identity of god and victim is often
      quite clear; thus, as we saw before, the sheep-Aphrodite was worshipped in
      Cyprus with an annual mystic and piacular sacrifice of a sheep; and the
      worshippers themselves were clad in sheepskins, a rite whose significance
      is now abundantly evident to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, then, at the stage we have at last reached, I will not
      attempt to distinguish in every case between the various superposed ideas
      in the sacrificial ceremony. Most sacrifices seem in the last resort to be
      substitutes for human-divine victims. Most seem to be sacramental, and
      most to be more or less distinctly piacular. I do not even know whether,
      in reconstructing afresh for others a series of rites the ideas of which
      have grown slowly clear to my own mind by consideration of numerous mixed
      examples, I have always placed each particular fact in its best and most
      effective position for illustration. The elements of the problem are so
      involved and so closely interosculating. For instance, I do not doubt that
      the great Phoenician and Carthaginian holocausts of human victims, which I
      was compelled at first to treat most inadequately, were mainly piacular in
      intention; nor do I doubt that the Greek hecatomb (or holocaust of a
      hundred oxen) was a mitigation or attenuation <span class="pagenum">357</span><a
      name="link357" id="link357"></a>of such gigantic human holocausts as
      these, or as those attributed to the British Druids. Asclepiades states
      expressly that every victim was originally regarded as a substitute for
      human sacrifice; and so, in the Elohistic account of the origin of burnt
      sacrifice, a ram is accepted as a substitute for the life of Isaac, the
      dearly-beloved son whom the chief or king, Abraham, intends to offer as a
      royal victim to his tribal god. Abraham says that the god himself will
      provide a victim; and the ram then, as it were, voluntarily offers itself.
      So at the great temple of Astarte at Eryx, where the victims were drawn
      from the sacred or divine herds kept at the sanctuary, the chosen beast
      was believed of its own accord to present itself at the altar. At the
      Dupolia in like manner a number of bulls were driven together round the
      holy table; and the bull was selected which voluntarily approached and eat
      of the sacred cakes; thereby not only showing himself to be a willing
      victim, but also doubly divine, first because he took the food intended
      for the god, and second because he swallowed the sacred corn, itself the
      duplicate body of the deity. (Compare, of course, the Hebrew shewbread.) I
      need not pursue this line of thought any further. <i>It must be obvious
      that many sacrifices at least are sacra-mentally-piacular god-slaying
      ceremonies, and that in most of them the god is slain, himself to himself,
      in human or animal form, as an expiation of crimes against his own
      majesty. Nor need I point out how this complex concept lies at the very
      root of Pauline theology</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to add, however, that the ideas here formulated must give a
      new meaning to many points we could not at first understand in ceremonies
      mentioned in our earlier chapters. I will take only one example&mdash;that
      of the place of Samoyed sacrifice which Baron Nordenskiôld saw on Vaygats
      Island. We can now divine the meaning of the heap of reindeer skulls piled
      around the rude open-air shrine; for reindeer are the sacred and
      the-anthropic animals of the northern races; while the preservation <span
      class="pagenum">358</span><a name="link358" id="link358"></a>of their
      heads at the hypothral altar of the elder gods or ghosts has its usual
      holy and oracular meaning. We can also guess why remains of a fireplace
      could be seen by the side, at which the sacrificial and sacramental meal
      was habitually prepared; and why the mouths of the idols were smeared with
      blood, in order to make the older gods or ghosts participators in the
      festival. Indeed, any reader who has followed me thus far, and who now
      turns back to the earlier chapters of this book, will find that many
      details appear to him in quite a different light, and will see why I have
      insisted beforehand on some minor points which must have seemed to him at
      the time wholly irrelevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other curious ceremonies that seem equally meaningless at first in
      narratives of travel will also come to have a significant meaning when
      thus regarded. For instance. Mr. Chalmers tells us that among the New
      Guinea natives of particular districts, &ldquo;pigs are never killed but
      in the one place, and then they are offered to the spirit. The blood is
      poured out there, and the carcase is then carried back to the village, to
      be divided, cooked, and eaten. Pigs&rsquo; skulls are kept and hung up in
      the house. Food for a feast, such as at house-building&rdquo;&mdash;a most
      pregnant hint&mdash;&ldquo;is placed near the post where the skulls hang,
      and a prayer is said. When the centre-post is set up, the spirits have
      wallaby, fish, and bananas presented to them, and they are besought to
      keep that house always full of food, and that it may not fall when the
      wind is strong.&rdquo; If we recall other cases elsewhere, we can hardly
      doubt that the pigs in these instances are killed as sacred victims at the
      grave of the chief family ancestor; especially when Mr. Chalmers also
      tells us that &ldquo;each family has a sacred place where they carry
      offerings to the spirits of deceased ancestors, whom they greatly fear.&rdquo;
      When sickness, famine, or scarcity of fish occur, it is these spirits that
      have to be appeased. And if we recollect once more that in so many cases
      the central post of the hut is based on a human or animal victim, both
      <span class="pagenum">359</span><a name="link359" id="link359"></a>in New
      Guinea and elsewhere, we can hardly doubt that to this household god or
      foundation-ghost the offerings at the central post are presented. Finally,
      the skulls of the pigs which are kept in the house and hung on the post
      remind us on the one hand of the skulls of ancestor-gods similarly
      preserved, and on the other hand of the skulls of theanthropic victims
      kept by the people of India at their festivals, or fastened by early
      Greeks and Romans on their temples. &ldquo;They cook the heads of their
      slain enemies,&rdquo; says Mr. Chalmers again, &ldquo;to secure clean
      skulls to put on sacred places.&rdquo; Adequately to develop the hints
      thus suggested, however, would require another book as long as the present
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet here is just one more such hint, from the same author, too pregnant to
      be omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the natives begin planting, they first take a bunch of bananas
      and sugar-cane, and go to the centre of the plantation, and call over the
      names of the dead belonging to their family, adding: &lsquo;There is your
      food, your bananas and sugar-cane; let our food grow well, and let it be
      plentiful. If it does not grow well and plentiful, you all will be full of
      shame, and so shall we.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they go on trading expeditions, they present their food to the
      spirits at the centre-post of the house, and ask the spirits to go before
      them and prepare the people, so that the trading may be prosperous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When sickness is in the family, a pig is brought to the sacred
      place of the great spirit&rdquo; (probably the chief ancestral ghost),
      &ldquo;and killed. The carcase is then taken to the sacred place of the
      family, and the spirits are asked to accept it. Sins are confessed, such
      as bananas that are taken, or cocoanuts, and none have been presented, and
      leave not given to eat them. &lsquo;There is a pig; accept, and remove the
      sickness.&rsquo; Death follows, and the day of burial arrives. The friends
      all stand round the open grave, and the chief&rsquo;s sister or cousin&rdquo;
      (the primitive priestess) &ldquo;calls out in a loud voice, &lsquo;You
      have been angry with us for <span class="pagenum">360</span><a
      name="link360" id="link360"></a>the bananas we have taken (or cocoanuts,
      as the case may be), and you have, in your anger, taken this child. Now
      let it suffice, and bury your anger.&rsquo; The body is then placed in the
      grave, and covered over with earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have in brief a perfect epitome of savage theology, savage
      ceremonial, and savage atonement. I could enlarge not a little on its
      numerous implications.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single quotation from Mr. Savage Landor&rsquo;s work on The Hairy Ainu
      of Japan will also serve as an excellent summary of such encyclopaedic
      barbaric theology. &ldquo;If they have any belief at all,&rdquo; he says,
      &ldquo;it is an imperfect kind of Totemism, and the central point of that
      belief is their own descent from the bear. This does not include the
      smallest reverence for their ancestor. They capture their Totem and keep
      it in captivity; they speak to it and feed it; but no prayers are offered
      to it. When the bear is fat, it is taken out of the cage to be ill-treated
      and baited by all the men present.&rdquo; Like the Khond Meriah and the
      tortures of martyrs. &ldquo;It is tied to a stake&rdquo; or <i>stauros</i>
      or accursed tree, &ldquo;and a pole is thrust into its mouth; and when the
      poor beast has been sufficiently tortured, pricked with pointed sticks,
      shot at with blunted arrows,&rdquo; like St. Sebastian, &ldquo;bruised
      with stones,&rdquo; like St. Stephen, &ldquo;maddened with rage and
      ill-usage, it is killed outright, and, ancestor as it may be, it makes the
      chief dish and <i>raison d&rsquo;etre</i> of a festival, where all the
      members of the tribe partake of its flesh. The owner of the hut in which
      the feast takes place then sticks the skull on to a forked pole, and sets
      it outside with the others at the east end of his hut. The skin is made
      into garments, or is spread on the ground to sleep on.&rdquo; Here, I need
      hardly say, we have sacrifice, sacrament, orientation, the sacred head,
      the use of the skin as a covering of the worshipper, and all the other
      traits of theanthropic substitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is more to our purpose now, however, to remember these two cardinal
      points: <i>first, that a dying god, human or animal, is usually selected
      as a convenient vehicle for the <span class="pagenum">361</span><a
      name="link361" id="link361"></a>sins of the people; and second, that
      &ldquo;without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin.&rdquo;</i>
      These two doctrines were commonly current all over the world, but
      especially in that Eastern Mediterranean world where Christianity was
      first evolved. Indeed, they were there so generally recognised that the
      writers of the earliest Christian tractates, the Apostolic Epistles, take
      them for granted as self-evident&mdash;as principles of which every
      intelligent man would at once admit the truth and cogency.

      CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;THE WORLD BEFORE CHRIST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hristianity <span
      class="pagenum">362</span><a name="link362" id="link362"></a>grew. It was
      a natural product. It did not spring, full-fledged, from any one man&rsquo;s
      brain, as Athene sprang from the head of Zeus. It was not even invented by
      any little group or school of men, Petrine or Pauline, the apostles or the
      disciples, the early church of Jerusalem, Antioch, or Alexandria.
      Christianity grew&mdash;slowly. It developed, bit by bit, for three long
      centuries, taking shape by gradual stages in all the teeming centres of
      the Roman world; and even after it had assumed a consistent form as the
      Holy Catholic Church, it still went on growing in the minds of men, with a
      growth which never ends, but which reveals itself even now in a thousand
      modes, from a Vatican Council to the last new departure of the last new
      group of American sectaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christianity grew&mdash;in the crowded cosmopolitanised seaports and
      cities of the Roman empire&mdash;in Antioch, Alexandria, Thessalonica,
      Cyrene, Byzantium, Rome. Its highway was the sea. Though partly Jewish in
      origin, it yet appears from its earliest days essentially as a universal
      and international religion. Therefore we may gain some approximate
      knowledge of its origin and antecedents by considering the religious
      condition of these various great towns at the time when Christianity began
      to spring spontaneous in their midst. We can arrive at some idea of the
      product itself by observing the environment in which it was evolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, Christianity grew&mdash;for the most part among <span
      class="pagenum">363</span><a name="link363" id="link363"></a>the lower
      orders of the cosmopolitan seaports. It fashioned itself among the slaves,
      the freedmen, the Jewish, Syrian, and African immigrants, the Druidical
      Gauls and Britons of Rome, the petty shopkeepers, the pauperised clients,
      the babes and sucklings of the populous centres. Hence, while based upon
      Judaism, it gathered hospitably into itself all those elements of
      religious thought and religious practice that were common to the whole
      world, and especially to the Eastern Mediterranean basin. Furthermore, it
      gathered hospitably into itself in particular those elements which
      belonged to the older and deeper-seated part of the popular religions,
      rather than those which belonged to the civilised, Hellenised, and
      recognised modifications of the state religions. It was a democratic
      rather than an official product. We have to look, therefore, at the elder
      far more than the younger stratum of religious thought in the great
      cities, for the influences which went to mould Christianity. I do not
      deny, indeed, that the new faith was touched and tinged in all its higher
      parts by beautiful influences from Neo-Platonism, Alexandrian Judaism, and
      other half-mystical philosophic systems; but for its essential groundwork
      we have still to go to the root-stratum of religious practice and belief
      in Antioch and Alexandria, in Phrygia and Galatia, in Jerusalem and Rome.
      <i>It based itself above all on sacrament, sacrifice, atonement, and
      resurrection</i>. Yet again, Christianity originated first of all among
      the Jewish, Syrian, or Semitic population of these great towns of the
      empire, at the very moment of its full cosmopolitanisation; it spread
      rapidly from them, no doubt at first with serious modifications, to the
      mixed mass of sailors, slaves, freedwomen, and townspeople who formed
      apparently its earliest adherents. Hence, we must look in it for an
      intimate blend of Judaism with the central ideas of the popular religions,
      Aryan or Hamitic, of the Mediterranean basin. We must expect in it much
      that was common in Syria, Asia Minor, Hellas, and Egypt,&mdash;something
      even from Gaul, Hispania, Carthage. Its first o w great <span
      class="pagenum">364</span><a name="link364" id="link364"></a>apostle, if
      we may believe our authorities, was one Saul or Paul, a half-Hellenised
      Jew of Semitic and commercial Tarsus in Cilicia, and a Roman citizen. Its
      first great churches sprang up in the busy ports and marts of the Levant.
      <i>Its very name of Christian was given to it first in the crowded and
      cosmopolitan city of Antioch</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is here, then, in these huge slave-peopled hives of Hellenised and
      Romanised commerce, that we must look for the mother-ideas of
      Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antioch was quite undoubtedly in the earliest times the principal cradle
      of the new religion. <i>I do not mean that Jerusalem was not very probably
      the place where men first began to form a small sect of esoteric
      Christ-worshippers, or that Galilee was not the region where the Christ
      himself most largely lived and taught, if indeed such a person ever really
      existed</i>. In those matters the traditions handed down to us in the
      relatively late Gospels may be perfectly correct: and again, they may not.
      But Christianity as we know it, the Christianity of the Pauline epistles
      and the later writings, such as the Gospels and the works of the Fathers,
      must have been essentially a cult of wider Syrian and Gentile growth. It
      embraces in itself elements which doubtless lingered on in secluded
      corners more or less among the mass of the people even in Judæa itself,
      though discountenanced by the adherents of the priestly and official
      Jahweh-worship; but which were integral parts of the popular and even the
      recognised religion throughout the whole of northern Syria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antioch, where Christianity thus took its first feeble steps, was a
      handsome and bustling commercial city, the capital of the Greek Seleucid
      kings, and the acknowledged metropolis of the Syrian area. <i>At the time
      of Paul (if there was a Paul)</i>, it probably contained half a million
      people; it was certainly the largest town in Asia, and worthy to be
      compared with Rome itself in the splendour of its buildings. Many things
      about its position are deserving of notice. It stood upon the banks of the
      Orontes, a <span class="pagenum">365</span><a name="link365" id="link365"></a>sacred
      stream, ensconced in a rich agricultural plain, fourteen miles from the
      river&rsquo;s mouth. Its Ostia was at Selucia, the harbour whence flowed
      the entire export trade of Syria and the east towards Hellas and Italy.
      The Mediterranean in front connected it with Rome, Alexandria, Asia Minor,
      Greece; the caravan routes across the Syrian desert in the rear put it in
      communication with the bazars of Mesopotamia and the remoter east. It was
      thus the main entrepôt of the through trade between two important worlds.
      The Venice of its time, it lay at the focal point where the highroads of
      Europe and of Asia converged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scholars of repute have pointed out the fact that even earlier than the
      days of Paul, Buddhist ideas from India seem to have dribbled through and
      affected the Syrian world, as Zoroastrian ideas a little later dribbled
      through and affected the thought of Alexandria: and some importance has
      been attached to this infiltration of motives from the mystical east. Now,
      I do not care to deny that budding Christianity may have been much
      influenced on its ritual and still more on its ethical side by floating
      elements of Buddhist opinion: that the infancy of the Christ may have been
      nursed by the Magi. But on the whole I think the facts we have just been
      considering as to the manufacture of artificial human gods and the nature
      and meaning of piacular sacrifices will suffice to show that Christianity
      was chiefly a plant of home growth. The native soil contained already
      every essential element that was needed to feed it&mdash;the doctrine of
      the Incarnation, the death of the Man-God, the atoning power of his Blood,
      the Resurrection and Ascension. So that, while allowing due weight to this
      peculiar international position of Antioch, as the double-faced Janus-gate
      of Europe and Asia, I am not inclined to think that points peculiar to
      Buddhism need have exercised any predominant influence in the evolution of
      the new religion. For we must remember that Buddhism itself did but
      subsume into its own fabric ideas <span class="pagenum">366</span><a
      name="link366" id="link366"></a>which were common to Peru and Mexico, to
      Greece and India, to Syria and Egypt, and which came out in fresh forms,
      surging up from below, in the creed of Christendom. <i>If anything is
      clear from our previous researches it is this&mdash;that the world has
      never really had more than one religion&mdash;&ldquo;of many names, a
      single central shape,&rdquo;</i> as the poet phrases it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Syrian people, Semites by race and cult, had fallen, like all the rest
      of the eastern world, under the Hellenic dominion of the successors of
      Alexander. A quick and subtle folk, very pliable and plastic, they
      underwent rapid and facile Hellenisation. It was an easy task for them to
      accept Greek culture and Greek religion. The worshipper of Adonis had
      little difficulty in renaming his chief god as Dionysus and continuing to
      practise his old rites and ceremonies to the newly-named deity after the
      ancestral pattern. The Astarte whom the east had given to Hellas under the
      alias of Aphrodite, came back again as Aphrodite to Astarte&rsquo;s old
      sanctuaries. Identifications of gods and cults were but simple matters,
      where so many gods were after all essentially similar in origin and
      function. Thus the easy-going Syrian had few scruples about practising his
      primitive ceremonies under foreign titles, or admitting to the hospitality
      of his Semitic temples the Hellenic deities of the reigning Antiochi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seleucids, however, did not fare so well in their attempt to impose
      the alien gods on the fierce Jehovistic zealots of the southern mountains.
      Antiochus IV. endeavoured in vain to force the cults of intrusive
      Hellenism on his new kingdom of Palestine. He reckoned without his hosts.
      The populace of Jerusalem would not away with his &ldquo;idolatrous&rdquo;
      rites&mdash;would not permit the worship of Zeus and Pallas, of Artemis
      and Aphrodite, to usurp a place in the holy city of Jahweh. The rebellion
      of the Maccabees secured at least the religious independence of Judæa from
      the early Seleucid period down to the days of Vespasian and Titus. Lower
      Syria remained true in her arid hills <span class="pagenum">367</span><a
      name="link367" id="link367"></a>to the exclusive and monotheistic cult of
      the God of Israel. And at the same time the Jew spread everywhere over the
      surrounding countries, carrying with him not only his straw and his
      basket, but also his ingrained and ineradicable prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Antioch, then, after the Roman absorption of Syria, a most cosmopolitan
      religion appears to have existed, containing mingled Semitic and Hellenic
      elements, half assimilated to one another, in a way that was highly
      characteristic of the early empire. And among the popular cults of the
      great city we must certainly place high those of Adonis and Dionysus, of
      Aphrodite-Astarte, and of the local gods or goddesses, the Baalim and
      Ashtareth, such as the maiden who, as we learnt from Malalas, was
      sacrificed at the original foundation of the city, and ever after
      worshipped as its Tyche or Fortune. <i>In other words, the conception of
      the human god, of the corn and wine god, of the death of the god, and of
      his glorious resurrection, must have all been perfectly familiar ideas to
      the people of Antioch and of Syria in general</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us note here, too, that the particular group of Jah-weh-worshippers
      among whom the Christ is said to have found his personal followers, were
      not people of the priestly type of Jerusalem, but Galilæan peasants of the
      northern mountains, separated from the most orthodox set of Jews by the
      intrusive wedge of heretical Samaritans, and closely bordering on the
      heathen Phoenician seaboard&mdash;&ldquo;the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.&rdquo;
      Here Judaism and heathenism marched together; here Jahweh had his
      worshippers among the fishers of the lake, while Hellenism had fixed
      itself in the statelier villas of Tiberias and Ptole-mais.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexandria was another of the great cosmopolitan seaport towns where
      Christianity made its earliest converts, and assumed not a few of its
      distinctive tenets. Now, in Alexandria, Hellenism and the immemorially
      ancient Egyptian religion found themselves face to face at very close
      <span class="pagenum">368</span><a name="link368" id="link368"></a>quarters.
      It is true, the town in its historical aspect was mainly Greek, founded by
      the great Macedonian himself, and priding itself on its pure Hellenic
      culture. But the mass of the lower orders who thronged its alleys must
      surely have consisted of more or less mongrel Egyptians, still clinging
      with all the old Egyptian conservatism to the ideas and practices and
      rites of their fathers. Besides these, we get hints of a large
      cosmopolitan seafaring population, among whom strange faiths and exotic
      gods found ready acceptance. Beside the stately forms of the Greek
      pantheon, and the mummified or animal-headed Egyptian deities, the
      imported Syrian worship of Adonis had acquired a firm footing; <i>the
      annual festival of the slaughtered god was one of the principal holidays</i>;
      and other Syrian or remoter faiths had managed to secure their special
      following. The hybrid Serapis occupied the stateliest fane of the hybrid
      city. In that huge and busy hive, indeed, every form of cult found a
      recognised place, and every creed was tolerated which did not inculcate
      interference with the equal religious freedom of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ptolemaic family represents in itself this curious adaptability of the
      Græco-Egyptian Alexandrian mind. At Alexandria and in the Delta, the kings
      appear before us as good Hellenes, worshipping their ancestral deities in
      splendid temples; but in the Thebaid, the god Ptolemy or the goddess
      Cleopatra erected buildings in honor of Ptah or Khem in precisely the old
      Egyptian style, and appeared on their propyla in the guise of Pharaohs
      engaged in worshipping Amen-Ra or Osiris. The great Alexander himself had
      inaugurated this system when he gave himself out as the son of &ldquo;Zeus
      Ammon&rdquo;; and his indirect representatives carried it on throughout
      with a curious dualism which excused itself under the veil of arbitrary
      identifications. Thus Serapis himself was the dead Apis bull, invested
      with the attributes of an Osiris and of the Hellenic Hades; while Amen-Ra
      was Zeus in an Egyptian avatar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large Jewish colony at Alexandria also prepared the way <span
      class="pagenum">369</span><a name="link369" id="link369"></a>for the
      ultimate admixture of Neo-Platonism in the Christian faith; while <i>the
      Egyptian belief in Triads of gods formed the groundwork for the future
      doctrine of the Trinity</i>, so doggedly battled for by the Alexandrian
      Athanasius. It is true that Ampère and Preller have strenuously denied any
      Egyptian admixture in the philosophy of Alexandria; and their reasoning
      may be conclusive enough as to the upper stratum of thought: but it must
      at least be admitted that popular belief in the city of the Ptolemies must
      have been deeply coloured by the ideas and creeds of its Egyptian
      substratum. Now, in the growth of Christianity, it was the people who
      counted, not the official classes, the learned, or the philosophic. We
      must not attribute to the population of the East End of London the
      theology of Pusey or the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christianity would seem also to have taken part at least of its form in
      Rome. And as Roman influence extended likewise over every portion of the
      vast empire, I must say a very few words here about the origin and growth
      of the Roman religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      That religion, as it comes upon us in the few glimpses we get of its early
      Italic and pre-Hellenised form, was one of the rudest and most primitive
      type, almost savage in its extreme simplicity. It knew hardly any great
      gods by name: the few deities it possessed, it expressed only for the most
      part by adjectival names. Few, I say, as to type, for as to number of
      individuals, their name indeed was legion; they pervaded the whole, world
      in that reckless multiplicity which distinguishes the simple ghosts or
      spirits of early hunting or pastoral peoples. With the Romans, this
      multiplicity, ubiquity, and vagueness survived into a relatively settled
      and civilised agricultural condition. A vast number of small departmental
      gods, with few or no great ones&mdash;that is the first state of the Roman
      pantheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The central point of old Roman religion was clearly the household; the
      family ghosts or <i>lares</i> were the most honoured <span class="pagenum">370</span><a
      name="link370" id="link370"></a>gods. We may instructively compare Mr.
      Chalmers&rsquo;s account of the theology of New Guinea. Beside these
      ancestral shades, or almost identical with them, came the <i>pénates</i>
      or practical deities of the store-room, perhaps the representatives of the
      victims slain as foundation-ghosts at the first erection of the building.
      Of these two, the Lares were undoubtedly the departed ancestors of the
      family; they lived near the spot where they were first buried (for the old
      Romans were buriers), and they still presided over the household as in
      life, like its fathers and senators. They were worshipped daily with
      prayers and simple offerings of food and drink; their masks or busts which
      hung on the wall were perhaps the representatives, or in ancient days the
      coverings, of the old oracular heads or skulls; for the skulls themselves
      may have been preserved in wax, as so often elsewhere at an earlier
      period. * The Penates, which were worshipped with the Lares, seem to have
      stood for the family spirit in a more generalised way; they represent the
      continuity and persistence of its Fortune; and therefore, if we may trust
      the analogy of the Fortune of a town, they are probably the ghosts of the
      foundation or renewal victims. In judging of all this, we cannot attach
      too great importance to the analogy of Negritto and Polynesian customs.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * To this use of the oracular head I would venture also to
     refer the common employment of small masks as amulets: an
     employment which, as Bottiger rightly remarks, explains &ldquo;the
     vast number of such subjects met with in antique gems.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Other deities are more public. But most of them seem to belong to the
      simplest and most immediately ghost-like stratum. They had to do with
      sowing, reaping, and vintage&mdash;in other words, were corn or wine gods.
      Or else they had to do with the navigable river, the Tiber, and the port
      of Ostia, which lay at its mouth&mdash;in other words, were spring and
      river gods. Or else they had to do with war and expeditions&mdash;in other
      words were slaughtered campaign gods of the Iphigenia pattern, Bellonas
      and battle-victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among <span class="pagenum">371</span><a name="link371" id="link371"></a>this
      dim crowd of elder manufactured deities, Saturnus, the sowing god, was
      most likely an annual corn-victim; his adjectival name by itself suggests
      that conclusion. Terminus, the boundary god, is already familiar to us.
      About these two at least we can hardly be mistaken. A red-haired man (as
      in Egypt) no doubt preceded as yearly corn-victim the red-haired puppies
      still slaughtered for the crops within the ken of Festus. Seia, Segetia,
      Tutilina, the successive corn-deities, we have already considered. They
      seem to equate with the successive maidens slain for the corn in other
      communities, and still commemorated in our midst by the corn-baby and the
      corn-wife. At each stage of age in the corn, a corresponding stage in the
      age of the human victim was considered desirable. But how reconcile this
      idea with the existence of numerous petty functional deities&mdash;gods of
      the door and the hinge?&mdash;with the Cunina who guards the child in the
      cradle, and the Statina who takes care of him when he begins to stand? I
      answer, all these are but adjectival gods, mere ghosts or spirits, unknown
      in themselves, but conceived as exercising this particular function.
      &ldquo;The god that does so-and-so&rdquo; is just a convenient expression,
      no more; it serves its purpose, and that was enough for the practical
      Roman. How readily they could put up with these rough-and-ready
      identifications we know in the case of Aius Locutius and of the Deus
      Rediculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Terminus and each Silvanus is thus the god or protecting ghost of
      each boundary stone or each sacred grove&mdash;not a proper name, but a
      class&mdash;not a particular god, but a <i>kind</i> of spirit. The
      generalised and abstract gods are later unifications of all the
      individuals included in each genus. The Janus, I take it, was at first the
      victim once sacrificed annually before each gate of the city, as he is
      sacrificed still on the west coast of Africa: as the god of opening, he
      was slaughtered at the opening of every new year; and the year conversely
      opened its course with the month sacred to the god of opening. Perhaps he
      was also slain <span class="pagenum">372</span><a name="link372"
      id="link372"></a>as fortune at the beginning of each war. The Vesta is the
      hearth-goddess; and every house had its Vesta; perhaps originally a
      slaughtered hearth-victim. Every man had in like manner his Genius, an
      ancestral protecting spirit; the corresponding guardian of the woman was
      her Juno; they descend to Christianity, especially in its most distinctive
      Roman form, as the guardian angels. Mars was a corn-spirit; only later was
      he identified with the expeditionary god. His annual expulsion as the
      human scapegoat has already been considered. The Jupiter or Jovis was a
      multiple wine-god, doubtless in every case the annual victim slain,
      Dionysus-wise, for the benefit of the vineyard. Each village and each farm
      had once its Jovis, specially worshipped, and, I doubt not, originally
      slaughtered, at the broaching of the year&rsquo;s first wine-cask in
      April. But his name shows that, as usual, he was also identified with that
      very ancient Sky-god who is common to all the Aryan race; the particular
      Jovis being probably sacrificed, himself to himself, before the old
      Sky-god&rsquo;s altar, as elsewhere the Dionysus-victim at the shrine of
      Dionysus.
    </p>
    <p>
      These identifications, I know, may sound fanciful to mere classical
      scholars, unacquainted with the recent advances in anthropology, and I
      would not have ventured to propound them at an earlier stage of our
      involved argument; but now that we have seen and learned to recognise the
      extraordinary similarity of all pantheons the whole world over, I think
      the exact way these deities fall into line with the wall-gods, gate-gods,
      corn-gods, wine-gods, boundary-gods, forest-gods, fountain-gods, and
      river-gods everywhere else must surely be allowed some little weight in
      analogically placing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The later Roman religion only widens, if at all, from within its own
      range, by the inclusion of larger and larger tribal elements. Thus the
      Deus Fidius, who presided over each separate alliance, I take to be the
      ghost of the victim slain to form a covenant; just as in Africa to this
      day, <i>when <span class="pagenum">373</span><a name="link373" id="link373"></a>two
      tribes have concluded a treaty of peace, they crucify a slave &ldquo;to
      ratify the bargain.&rdquo;</i> The nature of such covenant victims has
      been well illustrated by Professor Robertson Smith, but the growth of the
      covenant-gods, who finally assumed very wide importance, is a subject
      which considerations of space prevent me from including in our present
      purview. The victim, at first no doubt human, became later a theanthropic
      animal; as did also the Jo vis-victim and the representatives of the other
      adjectival or departmental deities. The Roman Mars and the Sabine Ouirinus
      may readily have been amalgamated into a Mars Ouirinus, if we remember
      that Mars is probably a general name, and that any number of Martes may at
      any time have been sacrificed. The Jovis of the city of Rome thus comes at
      last to be the greatest and most powerful Jupiter of them all, and the
      representative of the Roman union. Under Hellenising influences, however,
      all these minor gods get elevated at last into generalised deities; and
      the animal victims offered to them become mere honorific or piacular
      sacrifices, hardly identified at all with the great images who receive
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hellenising process went so far, indeed, at Rome that the old Roman
      religion grew completely obscured, and almost disappeared, save in its
      domestic character. In the home, the Lares still held the first rank.
      Elsewhere, Bacchus took the place of Liber, while the traits of Hermes
      were fastened on the adjectival Roman bargain-spirit Mercurius. Yet even
      so, the Roman retained his primitive belief in corn and wine gods, under
      the newer guises; his Ceres he saw as one with the Attic Demeter; his
      rural ceremonies still continued unchanged by the change of attributes
      that infected and transfigured the city temples. Moreover, the Romans, and
      later the cosmopolitan population of Rome, borrowed gods and goddesses
      freely from without in ever increasing numbers. In very early days, they
      borrowed from Etruria; later, they borrowed Apollo from Greece, and (by an
      etymological blunder) <span class="pagenum">374</span><a name="link374"
      id="link374"></a>fixed upon their own Hercules the traits of Heracles. On
      the occasion of a plague, they publicly summoned Asclepios, the Greek
      leech-god, from Epidaurus; and at the very crisis of the life-and-death
      conflict with Hannibal, they fetched the sacred field-stone known as
      Cybele, the Mother of the Gods, from Pessinus in Phrygia. The people of
      Pessinus with strange compliance let their goddess go; and the whole
      orgiastic cult of Attis was thus transported entire to Italian soil. The
      rites of the great festival were carried on at Rome almost as they had
      been carried on before in Phrygia; so that an Asiatic worship of the most
      riotous type found a firm official footing in the centre of the empire.
      The priest, indeed, was still an Asiatic, or at least not a Roman; but the
      expulsion of Hannibal from Italy which followed on this adoption of a
      foreign god, must have greatly increased the prestige and reputation of
      the alien and orgiastic deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The luxurious Aphrodite of Eryx in Sicily arrived in Rome about the same
      time with Cybele. Originally a Semitic goddess, she combined the Hellenic
      and oriental ideas, and was identified in Italy with the old Latin Venus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later still, yet other gods were imported from without. New deities flowed
      in from Asia and Africa. The population of the city under the early empire
      had almost ceased to be Roman, save in the upper strata; a vast number of
      slaves from all parts of the world formed the lowest layer in the crowded
      vaults: the middle rank was filled by Syrians, Africans, Greeks,
      Sicilians, Moors, and freedmen&mdash;men of all places and races from
      Spain or Britain to the Euphrates and the Nile, the steppes and the
      desert. The Orontes, said Juvenal, had flooded the Tiber. Among this mixed
      mass of all creeds and colours, subfusk or golden-haired, a curious
      mixture of religions grew up. Some of these were mere ready-made foreign
      importations&mdash;Isis-worship from Egypt; Jahweh-worship from Judæa;
      strange eastern or northern or African cults from the remotest parts of
      Pontus or Mauritania. Others were intermixtures <span class="pagenum">375</span><a
      name="link375" id="link375"></a>or rationalisations of older religions,
      such as Christianity, which mingled together Judaism and Adonis or Osiris
      elements; such as Gnosticism, which, starting from Zoroastrian
      infiltrations, kneaded all the gods of the world at last into its own
      supreme mystic and magic-god Abraxas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking a little deeper through the empire in general, we see that from
      the time of Augustus onward, the need for a new cosmopolitan religion, to
      fit the new cosmopolitan state, was beginning to be dimly felt and
      acknowledged. Soldiers, enlisted in one country, took the cult and images
      of their gods to another. The bull-slaying Mithra (in whom we can hardly
      fail to see a solar form of the bull-god, who sacrifices a bull, himself
      to himself, before his own altar) was worshipped here and there, as
      numerous bas-reliefs show, from Persia to Britain. The Gaul endeavoured to
      identify his own local war-gods with the Roman Mars, who had been
      Hellenised in turn into the duplicate presentment of the Greek Ares. The
      Briton saw his river-gods remodelled in mosaic into images like those of
      Roman Tiber, or provided with the four horses who drag the Roman Neptune,
      as Neptune had borrowed the representation at least from the Greek
      Poseidon. And this was all the easier because everywhere alike horses were
      sacrificed to sea or river, in lieu of human victims; just as everywhere
      corn-gods were dressed in green, and everywhere wine-gods wore coronals of
      vine-leaves on their holy foreheads. Men felt the truth I have tried to
      impress, that <i>everywhere and always there is but one religion</i>.
      Attributes and origin were so much alike that worship was rapidly
      undergoing a cosmopolitanisation of name, as it already possessed a
      similarity of rites and underlying features. Language itself assisted this
      unifying process. In the west, as Latin spread, Latin names of gods
      superseded local ones; in the east, as Greek spread, Hellenic deities gave
      their titles and their beautiful forms to native images. An artificial
      unity was introduced <span class="pagenum">376</span><a name="link376"
      id="link376"></a>and fixed by a conventional list of Greek and Roman
      equivalents; and in the west, as Greek art gained ground and spread, noble
      Greek representations of the higher gods in ideal human form became
      everywhere common.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was not enough. As the government was one, under a strong
      centralised despotism, it was but natural that the religion should be one
      also, under the rule of a. similar omnipotent deity. <i>Man makes his
      heaven in the image of earth</i>; his pantheon answers to his political
      constitution. The mediaeval hall of heaven had an imperial God, like the
      Othos or the Fredericks, on his regal throne, surrounded by a court of
      great barons and abbots in the angels and archangels, the saints and
      martyrs: the new religions, like spiritualism and Theosophy, which spring
      up in the modern democratic world, are religions of free and independent
      spirits, hardly even theistic. The Roman empire thus demanded a single
      religion under a single strong god. It tended to find it, if not in the
      Genius of Trajan or Antonine, then in some bull-slaying Mithra or some
      universal Abraxas. Materialists were satisfied with the worship of the
      Emperor or of the city of Rome: idealists turned rather to Isis or to
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      One religion there was which might have answered the turn of the empire:
      the pure and ideal monotheism of Judæa. But the cult of Jahweh was too
      local and too national; it never extended beyond the real or adopted sons
      of Israel. Even so, it gained proselytes of high rank at Rome, especially
      among women; as regards men, the painful and degrading initiatory ceremony
      of Judaism must always have stood seriously in the way of converts. Yet in
      spite of this drawback, there were proselytes in all the cosmopolitan
      cities where the Jews were settled; men who loved their nation and had
      built them a synagogue. If Judaism could but get rid of its national
      exclusiveness, and could incorporate into its god some more of those
      genial and universal traits which he had too early shuffled off&mdash;if
      <span class="pagenum">377</span><a name="link377" id="link377"></a>it
      could make itself less austere, less abstract, and at the same time less
      local&mdash;there was a chance that it might rise to be the religion of
      humanity. The dream of the prophets might still come true and all the
      world might draw nigh to Zion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this critical juncture, an obscure little sect began to appear among
      the Jews and Galilæans, in Jerusalem and Antioch, which happened to
      combine in a remarkable degree all the main requirements of a new
      world-religion. And whatever the cult of Jesus lacked in this respect in
      its first beginnings, it made up for as it went by absorption and
      permeation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Catholic Church: it stood for the world, not for a tribe or a
      nation. It was a Holy Church: it laid great stress upon the ethical
      element. It was a Roman Church: it grew and prospered throughout the Roman
      empire. It made a city what was once a world. Whence it came and how it
      grew must be our next and final questions.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;THE GROWTH OF CHRISTIANITY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HILE <span
      class="pagenum">378</span><a name="link378" id="link378"></a>the world was
      thus seething and fermenting with new faiths the creed of the Christ made
      its first appearance on the seaboard of Asia. In spite of certain remarks
      in my first chapter, <i>I am not such a &ldquo;gross and crass Euhemerist&rdquo;
      as to insist dogmatically on the historical existence of a personal Jesus.
      Of the Christ himself, if a Christ there were, we know little or nothing.
      The account of his life which has come down to us in the Gospels is so
      devoid of authority, and so entirely built up of miraculous fragments,
      derived from elsewhere, that we may well be excused for gravely doubting
      whether he is not rather to be numbered with St. George and St. Catherine,
      with Perseus and Arthur, among the wholly mythical and imaginary figures
      of legend and religion.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it is quite possible, or even probable, that there
      really did live in Galilee, at some time about the beginning of our
      accepted era, a teacher and reformer bearing the Semitic name which is
      finally Hellenised and Latinised for us as Jesus. If so, it seems not
      unlikely that this unknown person was crucified (or rather hung on a post)
      by the Romans at Jerusalem under the Procurator C. Pontius Pilatus; and
      that after his death he was worshipped more or less as a god by his
      immediate followers. Such kernel of truth may very well exist in the late
      and derivative Gospel story; a kernel of truth, but imbedded in a mass of
      unhistorical myth, which implicitly identifies him with all the familiar
      corn-gods and wine-gods of the Eastern Mediterranean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, <span class="pagenum">379</span><a name="link379" id="link379"></a>it
      is even possible that the Christ may have been deliberately put to death,
      at the instigation of the Jewish rabble, as one of those temporary divine
      kings whose nature and meaning we have already discussed. If this
      suggestion seem improbable from the lack of any similar recorded case in
      the scanty Jewish annals, I would answer that formal histories seldom give
      us any hint of the similar customs still surviving in civilised European
      countries; that many popular rites exist unheard of everywhere; and that
      the Jews were commonly believed through the Middle Ages to crucify
      Christian boys, like St. Hugh of Lincoln, in certain irregular and
      unrecognised ethnical ceremonies. Furthermore, lest I should be thought to
      adduce this instance through an anti-Semite tendency (which I do not in
      the slightest degree possess), I may add that even among Christians
      similar customs are believed to exist in rural parts of Italy at the
      present day,&mdash;there are villages where a man dies yearly as the
      representative of Christ; and that in my opinion the Oberammergau and
      other Passion Plays are survivals of like representations in which a
      condemned criminal, the usual substitute, did once actually enact the part
      of Christ. In short, I do not hesitate to say that <i>god-slaying
      ceremonies, more or less attenuated, have lingered on everywhere in
      obscure forms among the folk-rites and folk-customs of the most civilised
      peoples</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without doing more than briefly indicate this possibility, however, I pass
      on to say that <i>if ever there was really a personal Christ, and if his
      followers began by vaguely believing in his resurrection, the legend, as
      we get it, is obviously made up of collected fragments from all the
      godslaying customs and beliefs we have been considering in detail through
      the last six or seven chapters</i>. In the Gospel of his later believers,
      after the sect had spread widely among the Gentiles of the towns, <i>Jesus
      is conceived of as a corn and wine god, a temporary king, slain on a cross
      as a piacular atonement, and raised again from the dead after <span
      class="pagenum">380</span><a name="link380" id="link380"></a>three days,
      in the manner common to all corn and wine gods.</i> It is possible, of
      course, that the first believers may have fastened all these ideas on to
      an accidental condemnation and execution, so to speak; but it is possible
      too that the <i>Christ may actually have been put to death at the great
      spring feast of the Passover, in accordance with some obscure and
      unrecognised folk-rite of the rabble of Jerusalem</i>. I do not even
      pretend to have an opinion on this subject; I do not assert or deny any
      historical nucleus of fact: I am satisfied with saying that <i>the story
      on the whole exhibits the Christ to us entirely in the character of a
      temporary king, slain with piacular rites as a corn and wine god</i>. In
      this case at least, I am no dogmatic Euhemerist.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it was Professor Freeman who once quaintly described Buddhism as
      &ldquo;a blasphemous anticipatory parody of Christianity.&rdquo; <i>The
      learned historian&rsquo;s idea apparently was that the author of all evil,
      being aware beforehand of the divine intentions, had invented Buddhism
      before the advent of Christ, so as to discount the Christian Plan of
      Salvation by anticipation</i>. If so, we must regard all other religions
      as similar blasphemous attempts at forestalling God: for we shall see as
      we proceed that every one of them contains innumerable anticipations of
      Christianity&mdash;or, to put it conversely, that Christianity subsumes
      them all into itself, in a highly concentrated and etherealised solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the earliest Christian documents, the Pauline and other Apostolic
      Epistles, we get little information about the history of the real or
      mythical Christ. Shadowy allusions alone to the crucifixion and the
      resurrection repay our scrutiny. But through the mist of words we see two
      or three things clearly. The Christ is described as the son of God&mdash;that
      is to say of the Jewish deity; and he is spoken of continually as slain on
      a post or tree, the sacred symbol of so many old religions. He dies to
      save mankind; and salvation is offered in his name to all men. A careful
      reading <span class="pagenum">381</span><a name="link381" id="link381"></a>of
      the epistles from this point of view will give in brief an epitome of the
      earliest and least dogmatic yet very <i>doctrinal Christian theology. Its
      cardinal points are four &mdash;incarnation, death, resurrection,
      atonement</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The later accounts which we get in the Gospels are far more explicit. The
      legend by that time had taken form: it had grown clear and consistent. <i>All
      the elements of the slain and risen corn and wine god are there in
      perfection.</i> For brevity&rsquo;s sake, I will run all these accounts
      together, adding to them certain traits of still later origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The aspect of Christ as a survival of the corn-god is already clear in
      Paul&rsquo;s argument in First Corinthians on the resurrection of the
      body. This argument would strike home at once to every Greek and every
      Asiatic. &ldquo;That which you sow is not quickened unless it die. And
      when you sow, you sow not the body that is to be, but bare grain; it may
      be wheat or any other grain. But God gives it a shape as pleases him; to
      every seed its own body.&rdquo;</i> <i>The whole of this fifteenth
      chapter, the earliest statement of the Christian belief, should be read
      through in this connexion by any one who wishes to understand the close
      relation of the idea of sowing to the resurrection. It might have been
      written by any worshipper of Adonis or Osiris who wished to recommend his
      special doctrine of a bodily resurrection to a doubtful cremationist,
      familiar with the cult of Dionysus and of Attis.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest known rite of the Christian church was the sacramental eating
      and drinking of bread and wine together; which rite was said to
      commemorate the death of the Lord, and his last supper, when he eat and
      drank bread and wine with his disciples. <i>The language put into his
      mouth on this occasion in the Gospels, especially the Fourth, is
      distinctly that of the corn and wine god. &ldquo;I am the true vine; ye
      are the branches.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am the bread of life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take,
      eat, this is my body.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is my blood of the new testament.&rdquo;</i>
      Numberless other touches of like kind are scattered through the speeches.
      In the parable <span class="pagenum">382</span><a name="link382"
      id="link382"></a>of the vineyard, God the Father is described as the owner
      of a vineyard, who sends his only begotten son to receive the fruit of it:
      and the workers slay him. The first miracle at Cana of Galilee is one
      where water is turned into wine by the hand of Jesus: and so on through a
      long series of curious instances, which readers can discover for
      themselves by inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In early Christian art, as exhibited in the catacombs at Rome, the true
      vine is most frequently figured; as are also baskets of loaves, with the
      corresponding miracle of the loaves and fishes. <i>Multiplication of bread
      and wine are the natural credentials of the corn and wine god</i>. The
      earliest description we possess of Christ, that of John of Damascus,
      states that his complexion was &ldquo;of the colour of wheat&rdquo;; while
      in the apocryphal letter of Lentulus to the Roman Senate we read in the
      same spirit that his hair was &ldquo;wine-coloured.&rdquo; The Greek
      description by Epiphanius Monachus says that Christ was six feet high; his
      hair long and golden-coloured; and in countenance he was ruddy like his
      father David. All these descriptions are obviously influenced by the
      identification of the bread and wine of the eucharist with the personal
      Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>In the usage of the church from very early days, it has been customary
      to eat the body of Christ in the form of bread, and to drink his blood as
      wine in the sacrament. In the Catholic church, this continuous ceremony
      takes place at an altar, containing sacred bones, and is represented as
      being the offering of God, himself to himself, in the form of a mystic and
      piacular sacrifice. The priest drinks the wine or blood; the laity eat
      only the bread or body</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious custom which occurs in many churches of Sicily at Easter still
      further enforces this unity of Christ with the cult of earlier corn and
      wine gods, like Adonis and Osiris. The women sow wheat, lentils, and
      canary-seed in plates, which are kept in the dark and watered every second
      day. The plants soon shoot up; they are then tied together <span
      class="pagenum">383</span><a name="link383" id="link383"></a>with red
      ribbons, and the plates containing them are placed on the sepulchres
      which, with effigies of the dead Christ, are made up in Roman Catholic and
      Greek churches on Good Friday, &ldquo;just as the gardens of Adonis,&rdquo;
      says Mr. Frazer, &ldquo;were placed on the grave of the dead Adonis.&rdquo;
      In this curious ceremony we get a survival from the very lowest stratum of
      corn-god worship; the stratum where an actual human victim is killed, and
      corn and other crops are sown above his body. Even where the sowing itself
      no longer survives, the sepulchre remains as a relic of the same antique
      ritual. Such sepulchres are everywhere common at Easter, as are the
      cradles of the child-god at the feast of the winter solstice. The Pietà is
      the final form of this mourning of the corn-god by the holy women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing on to the other aspects of Christ as corn-god and divine-human
      victim, we see that he is doubly recognised as god and man, like all the
      similar gods of early races. In the speeches put into his mouth by his
      biographers, he constantly claims the Jewish god as his father. Moreover,
      he is a king; and his kingly descent from his ancestor David is insisted
      upon in the genealogies with some little persistence. He is God incarnate;
      but also he is the King of the Jews, and the King of Glory. Wise men come
      from the east to worship him, and bring gifts of gold and myrrh and
      frankincense to the infant God in his manger cradle. But he is further the
      Christ, the anointed of God; and, as we saw, anointment is a common
      element with numerous other divine-human victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, he is the King&rsquo;s son; and he is the only begotten son, <i>the
      dearly beloved son, who is slain as an expiation for the sins of the
      people</i>. The heavens open, and a voice from them declares, &ldquo;This
      is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo; He is affiliated, like
      all other such victims, on the older and earlier ethnical god, Jah-weh;
      and though he is himself God, and one with the Father, <i>he is offered
      up, himself to himself, in expiation of <span class="pagenum">384</span><a
      name="link384" id="link384"></a>the sin committed by men against divine
      justice. All this would be familiar theology indeed to the worshipper of
      Osiris, Adonis, and Attis.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The common Hebrew offering was the paschal lamb; therefore Christ is
      envisaged as the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world. In
      the paintings of the catacombs, it is as a lamb that the Saviour of the
      world is oftenest represented.</i> As a lamb he raises another lamb,
      Lazarus; as a lamb he turns the water into wine; as a lamb he strikes the
      living springs from the rock on the spandrils of the sarcophagus of Junius
      Bassus. But his birth in a manger is also significant: and his vine and
      his dove are almost as frequent as his lamb in the catacombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gospel history represents the passion of Christ essentially as the
      sacrifice of a temporary king, invested with all the familiar elements of
      that early ritual. Christ enters Jerusalem in royal state, among popular
      plaudits, like those which always accompany the temporary king, and the
      Attis or Adonis. He is mounted on an ass, the royal beast of the Semites.
      The people fling down branches of trees in his path, as they always fling
      down parts of green trees before the gods of vegetation. On Palm Sunday
      his churches are still decked with palm-branches or with sprays of
      willow-catkin. Such rites with green things form an integral part of all
      the old rituals of the tree-god or the corn-god, and of all the modern
      European survivals in folk-lore&mdash;they are equally found in the
      Dionysiac festival, and in the Jack-in-the-Green revels on English
      fair-days. The connexion with trees is also well marked throughout the
      Gospels; and the miracle of the barren fig-tree is specially mentioned in
      close connexion with the entry into Jerusalem. The people as he entered
      cried &ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; to the son of David and the prophetic words
      were supposed to be fulfilled, &ldquo;Behold, thy king cometh unto thee,
      meek, sitting upon an ass, and a colt, the foal of an ass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christ goes as a willing victim to the cross; he does not <span
      class="pagenum">385</span><a name="link385" id="link385"></a>seriously ask
      that the cup should pass from him. He foretells his own death, and
      voluntarily submits to it But he is also bought with a price&mdash;the
      thirty pieces of silver paid to Judas. Of all this, we had forecasts in
      the Khond, the Mexican, and various other rituals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, there is a trial&mdash;a double trial, before the high
      priest, and before Pilate. Such trials, we have seen, are common elements
      of the mock-king&rsquo;s degradation. Like all other similar victims, the
      Christ, after being treated like a monarch, is reviled and spat upon,
      buffeted and insulted. He is bound with cords, and carried before Pilate.
      The procurator asks him, &ldquo;Art thou the King of the Jews?&rdquo; and
      the Christ by implication admits the justice of the title. All the
      subsequent episodes of the painful drama are already familiar to us. The
      sacred victim is cruelly scourged that his tears may flow. As in other
      cases he is crowned with flowers or with bark, in order to mark his
      position as king of vegetation, so here he is crowned with a chaplet of
      thorns that adds to his ignominy. The sacred blood must flow from the
      sacred head. But still, he is clothed with purple and saluted with the
      words, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo; in solemn irony. He is struck
      on the head with a reed by the soldiers: yet even as they strike, they bow
      their knees and worship him. They give him to drink wine, mingled with
      myrrh; &ldquo;but he received it not.&rdquo; Then he is crucified at
      Golgotha, the place of a skull, * on a cross, the old sacred emblem of so
      many religions; it bears the inscription, &ldquo;The King of the Jews,&rdquo;
      by order of the Procurator. After the death of the Christ he is mourned
      over, like Adonis and Osiris, by the holy women, including his mother. <i>I
      do not think I need point out in detail the many close resemblances which
      exist between the Mother of the Gods and the Mother of God&mdash;the
      Theotokos</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * According to mediaeval legend, the skull was Adam&rsquo;s, and
     the sacred blood which fell upon it revived it. In
     crucifixions, a skull is generally represented at the foot
     of the cross.
</pre>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">386</span><a name="link386" id="link386"></a>thieves
      crucified with the Saviour have their legs broken, like many other sacred
      victims; but the Christ himself has not a bone broken, like the paschal
      lamb which was the Jewish substitute for the primitive human victim. Thus
      both ideas on this subject, the earlier and the later, seem to find an
      appropriate place in the history. Instead of having his legs broken,
      however, the Christ has his side pierced; and from it flows the mystic
      blood of the atonement, in which all Christians are theoretically washed;
      this baptism of blood (a literal reality in older cults) being already a
      familiar image at the date of the Apocalypse, where the robes of the elect
      are washed white in the blood of the lamb that was slain.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the crucifixion, the Christ is taken down and buried. But, like all
      other corn and wine gods, he <i>rises again from the dead on the third day&mdash;this
      very period of three days being already a conventional one in similar
      cases</i>. Every one of the surroundings recalls Osiris and Attis. It is
      the women once more who see him first; and afterwards the men. Finally, he
      ascends into heaven, to his Father, before the wondering eyes of his
      disciples and his mother. In each item of this, there is nothing with
      which we are not already familiar elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not pursue the analogy further. To do so would be endless. Indeed,
      I do not think there is an element in the Gospel story which does not bear
      out the parallel here suggested. The slight incident of the visit to
      Herod, for example, is exactly analogous to the visit of the false Osiris
      in modern Egypt to the governor&rsquo;s house, and the visit of the
      temporary or mock king in so many other cases to the real king&rsquo;s
      palace. The episode where Herod and his men of war array the Christ in a
      gorgeous robe is the equivalent of the episode of the Mexican king
      arraying the god-victim in royal dress, and is also paralleled in numerous
      other like dramas elsewhere. The women who prepare spices and ointments
      for the body recall the Adonis rites; Pilate washing his hands of the
      guilt of condemnation <span class="pagenum">387</span><a name="link387"
      id="link387"></a>recalls the frequent episode of the slaughterers of the
      god laying the blame upon others, or casting it on the knife, or crying
      out, &ldquo;We bought you with a price; we are guiltless.&rdquo; Whoever
      will read carefully through the > Gospel accounts, side by side with Mr.
      Frazer&rsquo;s well-chosen collection of mock-king narratives, will see
      for himself that endless other minor traits crop up in the story which may
      be equated with numerous similar incidents in the death and resurrection
      of the man-god elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very subjects of the parables are in themselves significant: the lord
      of the vineyard who sends his son, whom the hirers slay; the labourers who
      come at the eleventh hour: the sower and the good and bad ground: the
      grain of mustard-seed: the leaven of the Pharisees: the seed growing
      secretly: the sons in the vineyard. It will be found that almost all of
      them turn on the key-note subjects of bread and wine, or at least of
      seed-sowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what precise stages the story of the Galilæan man-god arose and fixed
      itself around the person of the real or mythical Jesus it would be hard to
      say. Already in the epistles we may catch stray glimpses, in the germ, of
      most of it. Already we notice strange hints and foreshadowings. Probably
      the first Jewish disciples had arrived at the outline of the existing
      story even before the Gentiles began to add their quotum. And when we look
      at documents so overloaded with miracle and legend as the Gospels and the
      Acts of the Apostles, we find it hard indeed to separate any element of
      historical truth from the enormous accretion of myth and legend. Still, I
      see no grave reason to doubt the general truth of the idea that the
      Christian belief and practice arose first among Galilæan Jews, and that
      from them it spread with comparative rapidity to the people of Syria and
      Asia Minor. It even seems probable that one Saul or Paul was really the
      person who first conceived the idea of preaching the new religion
      throughout the empire, and especially in the great cities, as a faith
      which might be embraced by both Jew and Gentile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, <span class="pagenum">388</span><a name="link388" id="link388"></a>while
      the young cult contained most of the best features of Judaism, viewed as a
      possible universal religion,&mdash;its monotheism, its purity, its
      comparative freedom from vile and absurd legends of the gods and their
      amours&mdash;it surpassed the elder faith in acceptability to the world at
      large, and especially to the people of Syria and western Asia. Every one
      of them could have said with perfect truth, &ldquo;Nothing is changed;
      there is but one god more to worship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the church spread, the legend grew apace. To the early account of the
      death and resurrection of the King of the Jews, later narrators added the
      story of his miraculous birth from a virgin mother, who conceived directly
      from the spirit of God wafted down upon her. The wide extent and the
      origin of this belief about the conception of gods and heroes has been
      fully examined by Mr. Sidney Hartland in his admirable study of the Legend
      of Perseus. The new believers further provided their divine leader with a
      royal genealogy from David downward, and made him by a tolerably
      circuitous argument be born at Bethlehem, according to the supposed
      prophecy&mdash;though if there ever was really a Jesus at all, it would
      seem that the one fact of which we could feel tolerably sure about him,
      was the fact of his being a man of Nazareth. Later writers put into his
      mouth a high moral teaching for its time, somewhat anticipated by Hillel
      and other rabbis, and perhaps in part of Buddhist origin; they also made
      him announce for himself that divine <i>rôle</i> of mediator and atoner
      which they themselves claimed for the Saviour of Mankind. He calls himself
      the vine, the bread of life, the good shepherd; he is called &ldquo;<i>the
      lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world</i>,&rdquo; by John the
      Baptist, an enthusiast whose fame has attracted him at last into the
      Christian legend. Very early, the old rite of water-lustration or baptism,
      adopted by John, was employed as one of the chief Christian ceremonies,
      the ceremony of initiation, which replaced with advantage the bloody and
      dangerous Jewish circumcision.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <span class="pagenum">389</span><a name="link389" id="link389"></a>allowed
      for far freer proselytism than Judaism could ever expect; and though no
      doubt at first the Christians regarded themselves as a sect of the Jews,
      and though they always adopted entire the Jewish sacred books and the
      Jewish God, with all the Jewish history, cosmogony, and mythology, yet the
      new religion was from the beginning a cosmopolitan one, and preached the
      word unto all nations. Such a faith, coming at such a moment, and telling
      men precisely what they were ready to believe, was certain beforehand of
      pretty general acceptance. When Constantine made Christianity the official
      creed of the empire, it is clear that he did but put an official stamp of
      approval on a revolution that had long been growing more and more
      inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one word, Christianity triumphed, because it united in itself all the
      most vital elements of all the religions then current in the world, with
      little that was local, national, or distasteful; and it added to them all
      a high ethical note and a social doctrine of human brotherhood especially
      suited to an age of unification and systematic government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally, even in the Gospels themselves, we get strange passing
      echoes of a mysterious identification of the Christ with the ancient
      Hebrew ethnical god, not as the Lord of the Universe alone, but vaguely
      remembered as the sacred stone of the ark, the Rock of Israel. &ldquo;The
      stone which the builders rejected, that one has become the head of the
      corner.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken;
      but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.&rdquo; And
      in a speech put into the mouth of Christ, he says to Peter, &ldquo;Rock
      thou art, and on this Rock will I build my assembly.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I can honestly assure the polemical Protestant divine
     that I am well aware of the difference in gender in this
     passage&mdash;and of its utter unimportance. The name Peter could
     not well be made feminine to suit a particular play upon
     words or to anticipate the objections of a particular set of
     trivial word-twisters.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sometimes, too, in the epistles the two ideas of the corn-god and the
      foundation stone-god are worked upon alternately. <span class="pagenum">390</span><a
      name="link390" id="link390"></a>"I have planted; Apollos watered.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Ye are God&rsquo;s husbandry; ye are God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. Let every
      man take care how he builds upon it. For other foundation can no man lay
      than that which is laid, which is the Christ, Jesus.&rdquo; Or again,
      &ldquo;You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
      Jesus, the Christ, being himself the chief corner stone.&rdquo; Whoever
      rereads the epistles by the light of the analogies suggested in this book
      will find that they positively teem with similar references to the
      familiar theology of the various slain man-gods, which must have been
      known to every one along the shores of the Mediterranean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church which was built upon this rock&mdash;and that Rock was Christ&mdash;has
      shown its continuity with earlier religions in a thousand ways and by a
      thousand analogies. Solar and astrological elements have been freely
      admitted, side by side with those which recall the corn and wine gods. The
      chief festivals still cling to the solar feasts of the equinoxes and the
      solstices. Thus every year the church celebrates in mimicry the death and
      resurrection of the Christ, as the Mediterranean peoples celebrated the
      death and resurrection of the Attis, the Adonis, the Dionysus, the Osiris.
      It celebrates the feast at the usual time for most such festivals, the
      spring equinox. More than that, it chooses for the actual day of the
      resurrection, commonly called in English Easter, and in the Latin dialects
      the Paschal feast (or Pâques), a trebly astrological date. The festival
      must be as near as possible to the spring equinox; but it must be after a
      full moon, and it must be on the day sacred to the sun. Before the feast,
      a long fast takes place, at the close of which the Christ is slain in
      effigy, and solemnly laid in a mimic sepulchre. Good Friday is the
      anniversary of his piacular death, and the special day of the annual
      mourning, as for Adonis and Attis. <i>On Easter Sunday, he rises again
      from the dead, and every good Catholic is bound to communicate&mdash;to
      eat the body of his slaughtered <span class="pagenum">391</span><a
      name="link391" id="link391"></a>god on the annual spring festival of
      reviving vegetation.</i> Comparison of the Holy Week ceremonies at Rome
      with the other annual festivals, from the Mexican corn-feast and the
      Potraj rite of India to Attis and Adonis, will be found extremely
      enlightening&mdash;I mean, of course, the ceremonies as they were when the
      Pope, the Priest-King, the representative of the annual Attis at Pessinus,
      officiated publicly in the Sistine Chapel, with paschal music known as
      Lamentations, and elevation of the Host amid the blare of trumpets. On
      this subject, I limit myself to the barest hint. Whoever chooses to follow
      out so pregnant a clue will find it lead him into curious analogies and
      almost incredible survivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, the birth of Christ is celebrated at the winter solstice, the
      well-known date for so many earlier ceremonies of the gods of vegetation.
      Then the infant god lies unconscious in his cradle. Whoever has read Mr.
      Frazer&rsquo;s great work will understand the connexion of the holly and
      the mistletoe, and the Christmas tree, with this second great festival of
      Christendom, very important in the Teutonic north, though far inferior in
      the south to the spring-tide feast, when the god is slain and eaten of
      necessity. I limit myself to saying that the Christmas rites are all of
      them rites of the birth of the corn-god.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the Christian cross, it is now known, was not employed as a symbol of
      the faith before the days of Constantine, and was borrowed from the solar
      wheel of the Gaulish sun-god-worshippers who formed the mass of the
      successful emperor&rsquo;s legionaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now, therefore, in a very different position for understanding the
      causes which led to the rise and development of the Christian religion
      from that which we occupied at the outset of our enquiry. We had then to
      accept crudely the bare fact that about the first century of our era a
      certain cult of a Divine Man, Jesus, arose among a fraction of the
      maritime people of Lower Syria. That fact as we at first received it stood
      isolated and unrelated <span class="pagenum">392</span><a name="link392"
      id="link392"></a>in its naked singularity. We can now see that it was but
      one more example of a universal god-making tendency in human nature, high
      or low; and in our last chapter we shall find that this universal tendency
      to worship the dead has ever since persisted as fully as ever, and is in
      fact the central element in the entire religious instinct of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main emotional chord upon which Christianity played in its early days&mdash;and
      indeed the main chord upon which it still plays&mdash;is just, I believe,
      the universal feeling in favour of the deification or beatification of the
      dead, with the desire for immortality on the part of the individual
      believer himself in person. Like all other religions, but even more than
      any other religion at that time in vogue, Christianity appealed to these
      two allied and deep-seated longings of human nature. It appealed on the
      one hand to the unselfish emotions and affections of mankind by promising
      a close, bodily, personal, and speedy reassociation of the living believer
      with his dead relatives and friends. It appealed on the other hand to the
      selfish wishes and desires of each, by holding forth to every man the sure
      and certain hope of a glorious resurrection. Like all other creeds, but
      beyond all other creeds, it was the religion of immortality, of the dead
      revived, of the new world: in an age of doubt, of scepticism, of the decay
      of faith, it gave fresh life and a totally new basis to the old beliefs&mdash;perhaps
      the old delusions&mdash;of the religious nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A necessary consequence of the universal ferment and intermixture of
      pantheons everywhere during the early days of the Roman empire was a
      certain amount of floating scepticism about the gods as a whole, which
      reaches its highest point in the mocking humour of Lucian, or still
      earlier in the Epicurean atheism of Lucretius and of Roman philosophy in
      general. But while this nascent scepticism was very real and very
      widespread, it affected rather current beliefs as to the personality and
      history of the various gods than the <span class="pagenum">393</span><a
      name="link393" id="link393"></a>underlying conception of godhead in the
      abstract. Even those who laughed and those who disbelieved, retained at
      bottom many superstitions and supernatural ideas. Their scepticism was
      due, not like that of our own time to fundamental criticism of the very
      notion of the supernatural, but to the obvious inadequacy of existing gods
      to satisfy the requirements of educated cosmopolitans. The deities of the
      time were too coarse, too childish, too gross for their worshippers. The
      common philosophic attitude of cultivated Rome and cultivated Alexandria
      might be compared to some extent to that of our own Unitarians, who are
      not indeed hostile to the conception of theology in its own nature, but
      who demur to the most miraculous and supernatural part of the popular
      doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the mass, however, the religious unrest showed itself mainly, as it
      always shows itself at such critical moments, in a general habit of
      running after new and strange religions, from some one or other of which
      the anxious enquirer hopes to obtain some divine answer to his doubts and
      difficulties. When old faiths decay, there is room for new ones. As might
      have been expected, this tendency was most clearly shown in the great
      cosmopolitan trading towns, where men of many nations rubbed shoulders
      together, and where outlandish cults of various sorts had their temples
      and their adherents. Especially was this the case at Rome, Alexandria, and
      Antioch, the capitals respectively of the Roman, the Hellenic, and the
      Semitic worlds. In the Græco-Egyptian metropolis, the worship of Serapis,
      a composite deity of hybrid origin, grew gradually into the principal cult
      of the teeming city. At Antioch, Hellenic deities were ousting the Baalim.
      At Rome, the worship of Isis, of Jahweh, of Syrian and other remoter
      Eastern gods was carried on by an ever-increasing body of the foreign,
      native, and servile population. These were the places where Christianity
      spread. The men of the villages were long, as the world still quaintly
      phrases it, &ldquo;pagans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">394</span><a name="link394" id="link394"></a>strange
      cults which united in thus gradually crushing out the old local and
      national pantheons throughout the Roman world, had for the most part two
      marked attributes in common: they were more or less mystical; and they
      tended more or less in the direction of monotheism. Solar myth,
      syncretism, the esoteric priestly interpretations, and the general
      diffusion of Greek philosophic notions, mixed with subtler oriental and
      Zoroastrian ideas, had all promoted the rise and growth of the mystic
      element: while a vague monotheistic movement had long been apparent in the
      higher thought of Egypt, Greece, Italy, and the East. In the resulting
      conflict and intermixture of ideas, Judaism, as one of the most mystical
      and monotheistic of religions, would have stood a good chance of becoming
      the faith of the world, had it not been for the fatal weight of its strict
      and obstinate national character. Even as it was, Jewish communities were
      scattered through all the commercial towns of the Græco-Roman world; a
      Jewish colony strongly influenced Alexandria; and Jewish teachers made
      proselytes in Rome in the very bosom of the imperial household.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ferment which thus existed by the Orontes, the Nile, and the Tiber
      must also have extended in a somewhat less degree to all the cosmopolitan
      seaports and trading towns of the great and heterogeneous military empire.
      What was true of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, was true in part, we have
      every reason to believe, of Damascus, of Byzantium, of Sinope, of Ephesus:
      of Rhodes, of Cyrene, of Athens, of Carthage; perhaps even of Massilia, of
      Gades, of Burdigala, of Lugdunum. All around the eastern Mediterranean at
      least, new faiths were seething, new ideas were brewing, new mysticisms
      were being evolved, new superstitions were arising, Phoenix-like, out of
      the dying embers of decaying creeds. Setting aside mere exotic or hybrid
      cults, like the worship of Serapis at Alexandria and of Isis at Rome, or
      mere abortive attempts like the short-lived worship of Antinous in Egypt,
      <span class="pagenum">395</span><a name="link395" id="link395"></a>we may
      say that three of these new religions appealed strongly to the wants and
      desires of the time: and those three were Mithraism, Gnosticism, and
      Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were alike somewhat eclectic in character; and all could lay claim to
      a certain cosmopolitan and catholic spirit unknown to the cults of the old
      national pantheons. All came to the Greek and Roman world from the mystic
      east, the land of the rising sun, whose magic is felt even at the present
      day by the votaries of Theosophy and of Esoteric Buddhism. Which of the
      three was to conquer in the end might have seemed at one time extremely
      doubtful: nor indeed do I believe that the ultimate triumph of
      Christianity, the least imposing of the three, inevitable as it at last
      became, was by any means at first a foregone conclusion. The religion of
      Jesus probably owed quite as much to what we call chance&mdash;that is to
      say, to the play of purely personal and casual circumstances&mdash;as to
      its own essential internal characteristics. If Constantine or any other
      shrewd military chief had happened to adopt the symbols of Mithra or
      Abraxas instead of the name of Christ, it is quite conceivable that all
      the civilised world might now be adoring the mystic divinity of the three
      hundred and sixty-five emanations, as sedulously as it actually adores the
      final theological outcome of the old Hebrew Jahweh. But there were certain
      real advantages as well, which told, I believe, in the very nature of
      things, in favour of the Christ as against the coinage of Basilides or the
      far-eastern sun-god. Constantine, in other words, chose his religion
      wisely. It was the cult exactly adapted to the times: above all others,
      during the two centuries or so that had passed since its first beginning
      (for we must place the real evolution of the Christian system considerably
      later than the life or death of Jesus himself) it had shown itself capable
      of thoroughly engaging on its own side the profoundest interests and
      emotions of the religious nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must remember, too, that in all religious crises, while <span
      class="pagenum">396</span><a name="link396" id="link396"></a>faith in the
      actual gods and creeds declines rapidly, no corresponding weakening occurs
      in the underlying sentiments on which all religions ultimately base
      themselves. Hence the apparent paradox that periods of doubt are also
      almost always periods of intense credulity as well. The human mind, cast
      free from the moorings which have long sufficed for it, drifts about
      restlessly in search of some new haven in which it may take refuge from
      the terrors of uncertainty and infidelity. And its new faith is always but
      a fresh form of the old one. A god or gods, prayer, praise, and
      sacraments, are essential elements. More especially is it the case that
      when trust in the great gods begins to fail, a blind groping after
      necromancy, spiritualism, and ghost-lore in general takes its place for
      the moment. We have seen this tendency fully exemplified in our own time
      by the spiritualists and others: nor was it less marked in the tempest of
      conflicting ideas which broke over the Roman world from the age of the
      Antonines to the fall of the empire. The fact is, the average man cares
      but little, after all, for his gods and his goddesses, viewed as
      individuals. They are but an outlet for his own emotions. He appeals to
      them for help, as long as he continues to believe in their effective
      helpfulness: he is ready to cajole them with offerings of blood or to
      flatter them with homage of praise and prayer, as long as he expects to
      gain some present or future benefit, bodily or spiritual, in return for
      his assiduous adulation. But as soon as his faith in their existence and
      power begins to break down, he puts up with the loss of their godhead, so
      far as they themselves are concerned, without one qualm of disappointment
      or inconvenience. It is something far other than that that touches him in
      religion: it is his hopes for his own eternal welfare, and the welfare
      after death of those that love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, a decline of faith in the great gods is immediately followed by a
      recrudescence of the most barbaric and original element in religion&mdash;the
      cult of the ghost or spirit, <span class="pagenum">397</span><a
      name="link397" id="link397"></a>necromancy, the direct worship of the dead
      or intercourse with the dead: a habit of enquiry into the positive chances
      of human immortality. This necromantic spirit is well marked in Gnostic
      remains, and in the fragmentary magical literature of the decadent
      Græco-Roman world. It is precisely the same tendency which produces
      spiritualism in our own time: and it is due to the desire to find some new
      and experimental basis for the common human belief in the immortality of
      the soul or the resurrection of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here we get the clue to the serious change which Christianity wrought
      in the religious feeling of the western world: a change whose importance
      and whose retrograde nature has never yet, I believe, been fully
      recognised. For Christianity, while from one point of view, as a
      monotheistic or quasi-monotheistic religion, an immense advance upon the
      aesthetic paganism of Greece and Italy, was from another point of view, as
      a religion of resurrection rather than a religion of immortality, a step
      backward for all Western Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even among the Jews themselves, however, the new cult must have come with
      all the force of an &ldquo;aid to faith&rdquo; in a sceptical generation.
      Abroad, among the Jewish Hellenists, Greek philosophy must have undermined
      much of the fanatical and patriotic enthusiasm for Jahweh which had grown
      stronger and ever stronger in Judæa itself through the days of the
      Maccabees and the Asmonæan princes. Scraps of vague Platonic theorising on
      the nature of the Divine were taking among these exiles the place of the
      firm old dogmatic belief in the Rock of Israel. At home, the Hellenising
      tendencies of the house of Herod, and the importance in Jerusalem of the
      Sadducees &ldquo;who say there is no resurrection,&rdquo; were striking at
      the very roots of the hope and faith that pious Jews most tenderly
      cherished. Instead of Israel converting the world, the world seemed likely
      to convert Israel. Swamped in the great absorbing and assimilating empire,
      Judah <span class="pagenum">398</span><a name="link398" id="link398"></a>might
      follow in the way of Ephraim. And Israel&rsquo;s work in the world might
      thus be undone, or rather stultified for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this very moment, when all faiths were tottering visibly to their
      fall, a tiny band of obscure Galilæan peasants, who perhaps had followed a
      wild local enthusiast from their native hills up to turbulent Jerusalem,
      may have been seized with a delusion neither unnatural nor unaccustomed
      under their peculiar circumstances; but which nevertheless has sufficed to
      turn or at least to modify profoundly the entire subsequent course of the
      world&rsquo;s history. Their leader, if we may trust the universal
      tradition of the sect, as laid down long after in their legendary Gospels,
      was crucified at Jerusalem under C. Pontius Pilatus. If any fact upon
      earth about Jesus is true, besides the fact of his residence at Nazareth,
      it is this fact of the crucifixion, which derives verisimilitude from
      being always closely connected with the name of that particular Roman
      official. But three days after, says the legend, the body of Jesus could
      not be found in the sepulchre where his friends had laid him: and a rumour
      gradually&rsquo; gained ground that he had risen from the dead, and had
      been seen abroad by the women who mourned him and by various of his
      disciples. In short, what was universally believed about all other and
      elder human gods, was specifically asserted afresh in a newer case about
      the man Christ Jesus. The idea fitted in with the needs of the time, and
      the doctrine of the Resurrection of Jesus the Christ became the
      corner-stone of the new-born Christian religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be clearer than the fact admitted on all hands, that this
      event formed the central point of the Apostles&rsquo; preaching. It was
      the Resurrection of Jesus, regarded as an earnest of general resurrection
      for all his followers, that they most insisted upon in their words and
      writings. It was the resurrection that converted the world of western
      Europe. &ldquo;Your faith is flagging,&rdquo; said the early Christians in
      effect to their pagan fellows: &ldquo;your gods are <span class="pagenum">399</span><a
      name="link399" id="link399"></a>half-dead; your ideas about your own
      future, and the present state of your departed friends, are most vague and
      shadowy. In opposition to all this, we offer you a sure and certain hope;
      we tell you a tale of real life, and recent; we preach a god of the
      familiar pattern, yet very close to you; we present you with a specimen of
      actual resurrection. We bring you good tidings of Jesus as the Messiah,
      and him crucified: to the Jews, a stumbling-block; to the Greeks,
      foolishness; but to such as are saved, a plain evidence of the power of
      the God of Israel. Accept our word: let your dead sleep in Christ in our
      catacombs, as once they slept in Osiris at Abydos, or rested upon him that
      rests at Philæ.&rdquo; &ldquo;If Christ be not risen,&rdquo; says one of
      the earliest Christian writers in a passionate peroration, &ldquo;then is
      our preaching vain, and your faith is vain also: but as it is, Christ is
      risen from the dead, and has become the first fruits of them that slept.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Else what shall they do,&rdquo; he goes on, touching to the quick
      that ingrained human desire for communion with the departed, &ldquo;what
      shall they do which are baptised for the dead, if the dead rise not at
      all? Why are they then baptised for the dead?&rdquo; These, in short,
      apart from the elements common to all creeds, are the three great motors
      of primitive Christianity: one dogmatic, the resurrection of Jesus: one
      selfish, the salvation of the individual soul: one altruistic, the desire
      for reunion with the dead among one&rsquo;s beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Syria and Egypt could easily accept the new doctrine. It involved for them
      no serious change of front, no wide departure from the ideas and
      ceremonies which always formed their rounded concept of human existence.
      There is a representation of the resurrection of Osiris in the little
      temple on the roof at Denderah which might almost pass for a Christian
      illustration of the resurrection of Jesus. To Syrian and Egyptian, the
      resurrection indeed was but a special modern instance of a well-known
      fact; a fresh basis of evidence upon which to plant firmly the tottering
      edifice <span class="pagenum">400</span><a name="link400" id="link400"></a>of
      their old convictions.&rsquo; In its beginnings, in short, Christianity
      was essentially an oriental religion; it spread fastest in the eastern
      Mediterranean basin, where Judaism was already well established: at Rome,
      it seems to have attracted chiefly the oriental population. And it is a
      significant fact that its official adoption as the public religion of the
      Roman state was the act of the same prince who deliberately shifted the
      seat of his government from the Tiber to the Bosphorus, and largely
      transformed the character of the empire from a Latin to a Græco-Asiatic
      type. All the new religions which struggled together for the mastery of
      the world were oriental in origin: the triumph of Christianity was but a
      single episode in the general triumph of aggressive orientalism over the
      occidental element in the Roman system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Egypt in particular, I believe, had far more to do with the dogmatic
      shaping of early Christianity, and the settlement of Christian symbolism
      and Christian mysticism, than is generally admitted by the official
      historians of the primitive church. There, where the idea of resurrection
      was already so universal, and where every man desired to be &ldquo;justified
      by Osiris,&rdquo; Christianity soon made an easy conquest of a people on
      whose faith it exerted so little change. And Egypt easily made its
      influence felt on the plastic young creed. It is allowed that the doctrine
      of the Trinity took shape among the Triad-worshippers on the banks of the
      Nile, and that the scarcely less important doctrine of the Logos was
      borrowed from the philosophy of Alexandrian Jews. Nobody can look at the
      figures of Isis and the infant Horus in any Egyptian museum without being
      at once struck by the obvious foreshadowing of the Coptic and Byzantine
      Madonna and Child. The mystery that sprang up about the new doctrines; the
      strange syncretic union of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost into a single
      Trinity; the miraculous conception by the Theotokos or mother of God&mdash;a
      clear variant in one aspect on the older idea of Hathor; and the antenatal
      existence of Christ <span class="pagenum">401</span><a name="link401"
      id="link401"></a>in heaven before his incarnation; all are thoroughly
      Egyptian in character, with a faint superadded dash of Alexandrian Jewish
      Hellenism. The love of symbols which the young church so early exhibits in
      the catacombs and elsewhere smacks equally of Ptolemaic reminiscences of
      Thebes and Memphis. The mummy-form of Lazarus; the fish that makes such a
      clever alphabetic ideogram for the name and titles of Jesus; the dove that
      symbolises the Holy Ghost; the animal types of the four evangelists&mdash;all
      these are in large part Egyptian echoes, resonant of the same spirit which
      produced the hieroglyphics and the symbolism of the great Nilotic temples.
      At the same time it must be remembered that sacred fish were common in
      Syria, and that similar identifications of gods with animals have met us
      at every turn, in our earlier investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, more, the very details themselves of Christian symbolism often go
      back to early Egyptian models. The central Christian emblem of all, the
      cross, is holy all the world over: it is the sacred tree: and each race
      has adapted it to its own preconceived ideas and symbols. But in Coptic
      Christianity it has obvious affinities with the <i>crux ansata</i>. In the
      Coptic room of the New Museum at Ghizeh is an early Christian monument
      with a Greek uncial inscription, on which is represented a cross of four
      equal limbs with expanded flanges, having a crux ansata inserted in all
      its four interstices. At the Coptic church of Abu Sirgeh at Old Cairo
      occurs a similar cross, also with suggestions of Tau-like origin, but with
      other equal-limbed crosses substituted for the <i>cruces ansatae</i> in
      the corners. * How far the Egyptian Christians thus merely transferred
      their old ideas to the new faith may be gathered from a single curious
      example. In Mr. Loftie&rsquo;s collection of sacred beetles is a scarabæus
      <span class="pagenum">402</span><a name="link402" id="link402"></a>containing
      a representation of the crucifixion, with two palm branches: and other
      scarabs have Christian crosses, &ldquo;some of them,&rdquo; says Mr.
      Loftie, &ldquo;very unmistakable.&rdquo; If we remember how extremely
      sacred the scarab was held in the Egyptian religion, and also that it was
      regarded as the symbol of the resurrection, we cannot possibly miss the
      importance of this implication. Indeed, the Alexandrian Father,
      Epiphanius, speaks of Christ as &ldquo;the scarabæus of God,&rdquo; a
      phrase which may be still better understood if I add that in the treatise
      on hieroglyphs known under the name of Horapollo a scarabæus is said to
      denote &ldquo;an only-begotten.&rdquo; Thus &ldquo;the lamb of God&rdquo;
      in the tongue of Israel becomes &ldquo;the scarabæus of God&rdquo; in the
      mouth of an Egyptian speaker. To put it shortly, I believe we may say with
      truth, in a sense far other than that intended by either prophet or
      evangelist, &ldquo;Out of Egypt have I called my son.&rdquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Count Goblet d&rsquo;Alviella&rsquo;s interesting work on The
     Migration of Symbols well illustrates this common syncretism
     and interchangeability of symbolic signs, which runs
     parallel with the syncretism of gods and religions.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the west, however, the results of the spread of Christianity were far
      more revolutionary. Indeed, I do not think the cult of Jesus could ever
      have spread at all in Rome had it not been for the large extent to which
      the city was peopled in later times by Syrians and Africans. And if
      Christianity had not spread in Rome, it could never have gained a foothold
      at all in the Aryan world: for it is not at bottom an Aryan religion in
      tone and feeling: it has only become possible among Aryan peoples by
      undergoing at last a considerable change of spirit, though not largely of
      form, in its westward progress. This change is indicated by the first
      great schism, which severed the Latin from the Greek communion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foremost among the changes which Christianity involved in Italy and the
      rest of western Europe was the retrograde change from the belief in
      immortality and the immateriality of the soul, with cremation as its
      practical outcome, to the belief in the resurrection of the body, with a
      return to the disused and discredited practice of burial as its normal
      correlative. The catacombs were the necessary <span class="pagenum">403</span><a
      name="link403" id="link403"></a>result of this backward movement; and with
      the catacombs came in the possibility of relic-worship, martyr-worship,
      and the adoration of saints and their corpses. I shall trace out in my
      next chapter the remoter effects of this curious revival of the prime
      element in religion&mdash;the cult of the dead&mdash;in greater detail: it
      must suffice here to point out briefly that it resulted as a logical
      effect from the belief in the resurrection of Christ, and the consequent
      restoration of the practice of burial. Moreover, to polytheists, this
      habit gave a practical opening for the cult of many deities in the midst
      of nominal monotheism, which the Italians and sundry other essentially
      polytheistic peoples were not slow to seize upon. Here again the
      difference between the more monotheistic and syncretic east, which puts a
      ban upon graven images, and the more polytheistic and separating west,
      which freely admits the employment of sculpture, is not a little
      significant. It is true that theoretically the adoration paid to saints
      and martyrs is never regarded as real worship: but I need hardly say that
      technical distinctions like these are always a mere part of the artificial
      theology of scholastic priesthoods, and may be as safely disregarded by
      the broad anthropological enquirer as may all the other fanciful lumber of
      metaphysical Brahmans and theologians everywhere. The genuine facts of
      religion are the facts and rites of the popular cult, which remain in each
      race for long periods together essentially uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we early get two main forms of Christianity, both official and
      popular: one eastern&mdash;Greek, Coptic, Syrian; more mystical in type,
      more symbolic, more philosophic, more monotheistic: the other western&mdash;Latin,
      Celtic, Spanish; more Aryan in type, more practical, more material, more
      polytheistic. <i>And these at a later time are reinforced by a third or
      northern form,&mdash;the Teutonic and Protestant; in which ethical ideas
      preponderate over religious, and the worship of the Book in its most
      literal and often foolish interpretation supersedes the earlier worship of
      Madonna, saints, pictures, statues, and emblems.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      At <span class="pagenum">404</span><a name="link404" id="link404"></a>the
      period when Christianity first begins to emerge from the primitive
      obscurity of its formative nisus, however, we find it practically
      compounded of the following elements&mdash;which represent <i>the common
      union of a younger god offered up to an older one with whom he is
      identified</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, as the implied basis, taken for granted in all the early
      Hebrew scriptures, there is current Judaism, in the form that Judaism had
      gradually assumed in the fourth, third, and second centuries before the
      Christian era. This includes as its main principle the cult of the one god
      Jahweh, now no longer largely thought of under that personal name, or as a
      strictly ethnic deity, but rather envisaged as the Lord God who dwells in
      heaven, very much as Christians of to-day still envisage him. It includes
      also an undercurrent of belief in a heavenly hierarchy of angels and
      archangels, the court of the Lord (modifications of an earlier
      astrological conception, the Host of Heaven), and in a principle of evil,
      Satan or the devil, dwelling in hell, and similarly surrounded by a crowd
      of minor or assistant demons. Further, it accepts implicitly from earlier
      Judaism the resurrection of the dead, the judgment of the good and the
      wicked, the doctrine of future rewards and punishments (perhaps in its
      fullest shape a Hellenistic importation from Egypt, though also commonly
      found in most spontaneous religions), and many other tenets of the current
      Jewish belief. In short, the very earliest Christians, being probably for
      the most part Jews, Galilæans, and proselytes, or else Syrians and
      Africans of Judaising tendencies, did not attempt to get rid of all their
      preconceived religious opinions when they became Christians, but merely
      superadded to these as a new item the special cult of the deified Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, as the Gospel spread to the Gentiles, it was not
      thought necessary to burden the fresh converts with the whole minute
      ceremonial of Judaism, and especially with the difficult and unpleasant
      initiatory rite of circumcision. <span class="pagenum">405</span><a
      name="link405" id="link405"></a>A mere symbolical lustration, known as
      baptism, was all that was demanded of new adherents to the faith, with
      abstinence from any participation in &ldquo;heathen&rdquo; sacrifices or
      functions. To this extent the old exclusiveness of Jahweh-worship, the
      cult of the jealous God, was still allowed to assert itself. And the
      general authority of the Hebrew scriptures, especially as a historical
      account of the development of Judaism, from which Christianity sprang, was
      more or less fully admitted, at first by implication or quotation alone,
      but afterwards by the deliberate and avowed voice of the whole Christian
      assembly. The translation of this mixed mass of historical documents,
      early cosmogonies, ill-reported and Jeho-vised Jewish traditions,
      misinterpreted poems, and conscious forgeries, in the Latin version known
      as the Vulgate, had the effect of endowing Europe for many centuries with
      a false body of ancient history, which must have largely retarded the
      development of the race up to our own time, and whose evil effects have
      hardly yet passed away among the more ignorant and conservative
      Bibliolatrous classes of modern society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superimposed upon this substratum of current Judaism with its worship of
      Jahweh came the distinctive Jesus-cult, the worship of the particular dead
      Galilæan peasant. This element was superadded to the cult of the Father,
      the great god who had slowly and imperceptibly developed out of the sacred
      stone that the sons of Israel were believed to have brought up with them
      from the land of Egypt. But how, in a religion pretending to be
      monotheistic, were these two distinct cults of two such diverse gods to be
      reconciled or to be explained away? By the familiar doctrine of the
      incarnation, and the belief in the human god who is sacrificed, himself to
      himself, as a piacular offering. Jewish tradition and subtler Egyptian
      mysticism sufficed to smooth over the apparent anomaly. The Jews looked
      forward to a mysterious deliverer, a new Moses, the Messiah, who was to
      fulfil the destiny of Israel by uniting all nations under the sceptre of
      David, and by <span class="pagenum">406</span><a name="link406"
      id="link406"></a>bringing the Gentiles to the feet of the God of Israel.
      Jesus, said the Christians, had proclaimed himself that very Messiah, the
      Christ of God; he had often alluded to the great Hebrew deity as his
      father; he had laid claim to the worship of the Lord of heaven. Further
      than this, perhaps, the unaided Jewish intelligence would hardly have
      gone: it would have been satisfied with assigning to the slain man-god
      Jesus a secondary place, as the only begotten Son of God, who gave himself
      up as a willing victim&mdash;a position perhaps scarcely more important
      than that which Mohammad holds in the system of Islam. Such, it seems to
      me, is on the whole the conception which permeates the synoptic Gospels,
      representing the ideas of Syrian Christendom. But here the acute
      Græco-Egyptian mind came in with its nice distinctions and its mystical
      identifications. There was but one god, indeed; yet that god was at least
      twofold (to go no further for the present). He had two persons, the Father
      and the Son: and the Second Person, identified with the Alexandrian
      conception of the Logos, though inferior to the Father as touching his
      manhood, was equal to the Father as touching his godhead&mdash;after the
      precise fashion we saw so common in describing the relations of Osiris and
      Horus, and the identification of the Attis or Adonis victim with the
      earlier and older god he represented. &ldquo;I and my Father are one,&rdquo;
      says the Christ of the Fourth Gospel, the embodiment and incarnation of
      the Alexandrian Logos. And in the very forefront of that manifesto of
      Neo-Platonic Christianity comes the dogmatic assertion, &ldquo;In the
      beginning was the Logos: and the Logos dwelt with God: and the Logos <i>was</i>
      God.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so the basis of the new creed is still incomplete. The Father and Son
      give the whole of the compound deity as the popular mind, everywhere and
      always, has commonly apprehended it. But the scholastic and theological
      intelligence needed a Third Person to complete the Trinity which to all
      mankind, as especially to orientals, is the <span class="pagenum">407</span><a
      name="link407" id="link407"></a>only perfect and thoroughly rounded
      figure. In later days, no doubt, the Madonna would have been chosen to
      fill up the blank, and, on the analogy of Isis, would have filled it most
      efficiently. As a matter of fact, in the creed of Christendom as the
      Catholic people know it, the Madonna is really one of the most important
      personages. But in those early formative times, the cult of the Theotokos
      had hardly yet assumed its full importance: perhaps, indeed, the Jewish
      believers would have been shocked at the bare notion of the worship of a
      woman, the readmission of an Astarte, a Queen of Heaven, into the faith of
      Israel. Another object of adoration had therefore to be found. It was
      discovered in that vague essence, the <i>Holy Ghost, or Divine Wisdom,
      whose gradual development and dissociation from God himself is one of the
      most curious chapters in all the history of artificial god-making</i>. The
      &ldquo;spirit of Jahweh&rdquo; had frequently been mentioned in Hebrew
      writings; and with so invisible and unapproachable a deity as the Jewish
      God, was often made to do duty as a messenger or intermediary where the
      personal presence of Jahweh himself would have been felt to contravene the
      first necessities of incorporeal divinity. It was the &ldquo;spirit of
      Jahweh&rdquo; that came upon the prophets: it was the &ldquo;wisdom of
      Jahweh&rdquo; that the poets described, and that grew at last to be
      detached from the personality of God, and alluded to almost as a living
      individual. In the early church, this &ldquo;spirit of God,&rdquo; this
      &ldquo;holy spirit,&rdquo; was supposed to be poured forth upon the heads
      of believers: it descended upon Jesus himself in the visible form of a
      dove from heaven, and upon the disciples at Pentecost as tongues of fire.
      <i>Gradually, the conception of a personal Holy Ghost took form and
      definiteness: an Alexandrian monk insisted on the necessity for a Triad of
      gods who were yet one God: and by the time the first creeds of the nascent
      church were committed to writing, the Spirit had come to rank with the
      Father and the Son as the Third Person in the ever-blessed Trinity.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      By <span class="pagenum">408</span><a name="link408" id="link408"></a>this
      time, too, it is pretty clear that the original manhood of Jesus had got
      merged in the idea of his eternal godhead; he was regarded as the Logos,
      come down from heaven, where he had existed before all worlds, and
      incarnate by the Holy Ghost in the Virgin Mary. The other articles of the
      Christian faith clustered gradually round these prime elements: the myth
      gathered force; the mysticism increased; the secondary divine beings or
      saints grew vastly in numbers; and the element of Judaism disappeared
      piecemeal, while a new polytheism and a new sacerdotalism took root apace
      in the Aryan world. I shall strive to show, however, in my concluding
      chapters, how even to the very end the worship of the dead is still the
      central force in modern Christianity: how religion, whatever its form, can
      never wander far from that fundamental reality: and how, whenever by force
      of circumstances the gods become too remote from human life, so that the
      doctrine of resurrection or personal immortality is endangered for a time,
      and reunion with relations in the other world becomes doubtful or
      insecure, a reaction is sure to set in which takes things back once more
      to these fundamental concepts, the most persistent and perpetually
      recurrent element in all religious thinking.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;SURVIVALS IN CHRISTENDOM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E <span
      class="pagenum">409</span><a name="link409" id="link409"></a>have now
      travelled far, apparently, from that primitive stage of god-making where
      the only known gods are the corpses, mummies, skulls, ghosts, or spirits
      of dead chieftains or dead friends and relations. The God of Christianity,
      in his fully-evolved form, especially as known to thinkers and
      theologians, is a being so vast, so abstract, so ubiquitous, so eternal,
      that he seems to have hardly and points of contact at all with the simple
      ancestral spirit or sacred stone from which in the last resort he appears
      to be descended. Yet even here, we must beware of being misled by too
      personal an outlook. While the higher minds in Christendom undoubtedly
      conceive of the Christian God in terms of Mansel and Martineau, the lower
      minds even among ourselves conceive of him in far simpler and more
      material fashions. A good deal of enquiry among ordinary English people of
      various classes, not always the poorest, convinces me that to large
      numbers of them God is envisaged as possessing a material human form, more
      or less gaseous in composition; that, in spite of the Thirty-nine
      Articles, he has body, parts, and passions; that he is usually pictured to
      the mind&rsquo;s eye as about ten or twelve feet high, with head, hands,
      eyes and mouth, used to see with and speak with in human fashion; and that
      he sits on a throne, like a king that he is, surrounded by a visible court
      of angels and archangels. Italian art so invariably represents him, with a
      frankness unknown to Protestant Christendom. Instead of <span
      class="pagenum">410</span><a name="link410" id="link410"></a>being in all
      places at once, pervading and underlying nature, the Deity is conceived of
      by most of his worshippers as having merely the power of annihilating
      space, and finding himself wherever he likes at a given moment. His
      omniscience and omnipotence are readily granted; but his abstractness and
      immateriality are not really grasped by one out of a thousand of his
      believers in Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, so abstract a conception as the highest theological
      conception of God cannot be realised except symbolically, and then for a
      few moments only, in complete isolation. The moment God is definitely
      thought of in connexion with any cosmic activity, still more in connexion
      with any human need, he is inevitably thought of on human analogies, and
      more or less completely anthropomorphised in the brain of the believer.
      Being by origin an offshoot of the mind of man, a great deified human
      being, he retains necessarily still, for all save a few very mystical or
      ontological souls, the obvious marks of his ultimate descent from a ghost
      or spirit. Indeed, on the mental as opposed to the bodily side, he does so
      for us all; since even theologians freely ascribe to him such human
      feelings as love, affection, a sense of justice, a spirit of mercy, of
      truth, of wisdom: knowledge, will, the powers of intellect, all the
      essential and fundamental human faculties and emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, far as we seem to have travelled from our base in the most exalted
      concepts of God, we are nearer to it still than most of us imagine.
      Moreover, in spite of this height to which the highest minds have raised
      their idea of the Deity, as the creator, sustainer, and mover of the
      universe, every religion, however monotheistic, still continues to make
      new minor gods for itself out of the dead as they die, and to worship
      these gods with even more assiduous worship than it bestows upon the great
      God of Christendom or the great gods of the central pantheon. And the
      Christian religion makes such minor deities no less than all <span
      class="pagenum">411</span><a name="link411" id="link411"></a>others. <i>The
      fact is, the religious emotion takes its origin from the affection and
      regard felt for the dead by survivors, mingled with the hope and belief
      that they may be of some use or advantage, temporal or spiritual, to those
      who call upon them</i>; and these primitive faiths and feelings remain so
      ingrained in the very core of humanity that even the most abstract of all
      religions, like the Protestant schism, cannot wholly choke them, while
      recrudescences of the original creed and custom spring up from time to
      time in the form of spiritualism, theosophy, and other vague types of
      simple ghost-worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most advanced religions, however, and especially Christianity in its
      central, true, and main form of Catholicism, have found it <i>necessary to
      keep renewing from time to time the stock of minor gods&mdash;here
      arbitrarily known as saints</i>&mdash;much as the older religions found it
      always necessary from year to year to renew the foundation-gods, the corn
      and wine gods, and the other special deities of the manufactured order, by
      a constant supply of theanthropic victims. What I wish more particularly
      to point out here, however, is that <i>the vast majority of places of
      worship all the world over are still erected, as at the very beginning,
      above the body of a dead man or woman</i>; that the chief objects of
      worship in every shrine are still, as always, such cherished bodies of
      dead men and women; and that the primitive connexion of Religion with
      Death has never for a moment been practically severed in the greater part
      of the world,&mdash;not even in Protestant England and America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. William Simpson was one of the first persons to point out this curious
      underlying connexion between churches, temples, mosques, or topes, and a
      tomb or monument. He has proved his point in a very full manner, and I
      would refer the reader who wishes to pursue this branch of the subject at
      length to his interesting monographs. In this work, I will confine my
      attention mainly to <i>the continued presence of this death-element in
      Christianity</i>; but by way of illustration, I will preface my remarks
      <span class="pagenum">412</span><a name="link412" id="link412"></a>by a
      few stray instances picked up at random from the neighbouring and
      interesting field of Islam.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no religion in all the world which professes to be more purely
      monotheistic in character than Mohammedanism. The unity of God, in the
      very strictest sense, is the one dogma round which the entire creed of
      Islam centres. More than any other cult, it represents itself as a
      distinct reaction against the polytheism and superstition of surrounding
      faiths. The isolation of Allah is its one great dogma. If, therefore, we
      find even in this most monotheistic of existing religious systems a large
      element of practically polytheistic survival&mdash;if we find that even
      here the Worship of the Dead remains, as a chief component in religious
      practice, if not in religious theory, we shall be fairly entitled to
      conclude, I think, that such constituents are indeed of the very essence
      of religious thinking, and we shall be greatly strengthened in the
      conclusions at which we previously arrived as to a <i>belief in
      immortality or continued life of the dead being in fact the core and basis
      of worship and of deity.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some eight or ten years since, when I first came practically into
      connexion with Islam in Algeria and Egypt, I was immediately struck by the
      wide prevalence among the Mahommedan population of forms of worship for
      which I was little prepared by anything I had previously read or heard as
      to the nature and practice of that exclusive and ostentatiously
      monotheistic faith. Two points, indeed, forcibly strike any visitor who
      for the first time has the opportunity of observing a Mahommedan community
      in its native surroundings. The first is the universal habit on the part
      of the women of visiting the cemeteries and mourning or praying over the
      graves of their relations on Friday, the sacred day of Islam. The second
      is the frequency of Koubbas, or little whitewashed mosque-tombs erected
      over the remains of Marabouts, fakeers, or local saints, which form the
      real centres for the religion and worship of every village. Islam, in
      practice, is a religion <span class="pagenum">413</span><a name="link413"
      id="link413"></a>of pilgrimages to the tombs of the dead. In Algeria,
      every hillside is dotted over with these picturesque little whitewashed
      domes, each overshadowed by its sacred date-palm, each surrounded by its
      small walled enclosure or <i>temenos</i> of prickly pear or agave, and
      each attended by its local ministrant, who takes charge of the tomb and of
      the alms of the faithful. Holy body, sacred stone, tree, well, and priest&mdash;not
      an element of the original cult of the dead is lacking. Numerous
      pilgrimages are made to these koubbas by the devout: and on Friday
      evenings the little courtyards are almost invariably thronged by a crowd
      of eager and devoted worshippers. Within, the bones of the holy man lie
      preserved in a frame hung about with rosaries, pictures, and other
      oblations of his ardent disciples, exactly as in the case of Roman
      Catholic chapels. The saint, in fact, is quite as much an institution of
      monotheistic Islam as of any other religion with which I am practically
      acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two peculiarities of the cult of Islam strike a stranger immediately
      on the most casual visit. When he comes to look at the matter more
      closely, however, he finds also that most of the larger mosques in the
      principal towns are themselves similarly built to contain and enshrine the
      bones of saintly personages, more or less revered in their immediate
      neighbourhood. Some of these are indeed so holy that their bones have been
      duplicated exactly like the wood of the true cross, and two tombs have
      been built in separate places where the whole or a portion of the supposed
      remains are said to be buried. I will only specify as instances of such
      holy tombs the sacred city of Kerouan in Tunisia, which ranks second to
      Mecca and Medina alone in the opinion of all devout western Mohammedans.
      Here, the most revered building is the shrine of &ldquo;The Companion of
      the Prophet,&rdquo; who lies within a catafalque covered with palls of
      black velvet and silver&mdash;as funereal a monument as is known to me
      anywhere. Close by stands the catafalque of an Indian saint while <span
      class="pagenum">414</span><a name="link414" id="link414"></a>other holy
      tomb-mosques abound in the city. In Algiers town, the holiest place is
      similarly the mosque-tomb of Sidi Abd-er-Rahman, which contains the shrine
      and body of that saint, who died in 1471. Around him, so as to share his
      sacred burial-place (like the Egyptians who wished to be interred with
      Osiris), lie the bodies of several Deys and Pashas. Lights are kept
      constantly burning at the saint&rsquo;s tomb, which is hung with
      variously-coloured drapery, after the old Semitic fashion, while banners
      and ostrich-eggs, the gifts of the faithful, dangle ostentatiously round
      it from the decorated ceiling. Still more sacred in its way is the
      venerable shrine of Sidi Okba near Biskra, one of the most ancient places
      of worship in the Mahommedan world. The tomb of the great saint stands in
      a chantry, screened off from the noble mosque which forms the
      ante-chamber, and is hung round with silk and other dainty offerings. On
      the front an inscription in very early Cufic characters informs us that
      &ldquo;This is the tomb of Okba, son of Nafa: May Allah have mercy upon
      him.&rdquo; The mosque is a famous place of pilgrimage, and a belief
      obtains that when the Sidi is rightly invoked, a certain minaret in its
      front will nod in acceptance of the chosen worshipper. I could multiply
      instances indefinitely, but refrain on purpose. All the chief mosques at
      Tlemçen, Constantine, and the other leading North African towns similarly
      gather over the bodies of saints or <i>marabouts</i>, who are invoked in
      prayer, and to whom every act of worship is offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      All over Islam we get such holy grave-mosques. The tomb of the Prophet at
      Medina heads the list: with the equally holy tomb of his daughter Fatima.
      Among the Shiahs, Ali&rsquo;s grave at Nejef and Hoseyn&rsquo;s grave at
      Kerbela are as sacred as that of the Prophet at Medina. The shrines of the
      Imams are much adored in Persia. The graves of the peers in India, the
      Ziarets of the fakeers in Afghanistan, show the same tendency. In
      Palestine, says Major <span class="pagenum">415</span><a name="link415"
      id="link415"></a>Conder, worship at the tombs of local saints &ldquo;represents
      the real religion of the peasant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had originally intended, indeed, to include in this work a special
      chapter on these survivals in Islam, a vast number of which I have
      collected in various places; but my book has already swelled to so much
      larger dimensions than I had originally contemplated that I am compelled
      reluctantly to forego this disquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word, however, must be given to Egypt, where the cult of the dead was
      always so marked a feature in the developed religion, and where neither
      Christianity nor Islam has been able to obscure this primitive tendency.
      Nothing is more noticeable in the Nile Valley than the extraordinary way
      in which the habits and ideas as to burial and the preservation of the
      dead have survived in spite of the double and rapid alteration in
      religious theory. At Sak-karah and Thebes, one is familiar with the
      streets and houses of tombs, regularly laid out so as to form in the
      strictest sense a true Necropolis, or city of the dead. Just outside
      Cairo, on the edge of the desert, a precisely similar modern Necropolis
      exists to this day, regularly planned in streets and quarters, with the
      tomb of each family standing in its own courtyard or enclosure, and often
      very closely resembling the common round-roofed or domed Egyptian houses.
      In this town of dead bodies, every distinction of rank and wealth may now
      be observed. The rich are buried under splendid mausolea of great
      architectural pretensions; the poor occupy humble tombs just raised above
      the surface of the desert, and marked at head and foot with rough and
      simple Egyptian tombstones. Still, the entire aspect of such a cemetery is
      the aspect of a town. In northern climates, the dead sleep their last
      sleep under grassy little tumuli, wholly unlike the streets of a city: in
      Egypt, to this day, the dead occupy, as in life, whole lanes and alleys of
      eternal houses. Even the spirit which produced the Pyramids and the Tombs
      of the Kings is conspicuous in modern or mediaeval Cairo in <span
      class="pagenum">416</span><a name="link416" id="link416"></a>the taste
      which begot those vast domed mosques known as the Tombs of the Khalifs and
      the Tombs of the Mamelooks. Whatever is biggest in the neighbourhood of
      ancient Memphis turns out on examination to be the last resting-place of a
      Dead Man, and a place of worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every one of the great mosques of Cairo is either a tomb built for
      himself by a ruler&mdash;and this is the more frequent case&mdash;or else
      the holy shrine of some saint of Islam. It is characteristic of Egypt,
      however, where king and god have always been so closely combined, that
      while elsewhere the mosque is usually the prayer-tomb of a holy man, in
      Cairo it is usually the memorial-temple of a Sultan, an Emeer, a viceroy,
      or a Khedive. It is interesting to find, too, after all we have seen as to
      the special sanctity of the oracular head, that perhaps the holiest of all
      these mosques contains the head of Hoseyn, the grandson of the Prophet. A
      ceremonial washing is particularly mentioned in the story of its
      translation. The mosque of Sultan Hassan, with its splendid mausolem, is a
      peculiarly fine example of the temple-tombs of Cairo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not linger any longer, however, in the precincts of Islam, further
      than to mention the significant fact that the great central object of
      worship for the Mahommedan world is the Kaaba at Mecca, which itself, as
      Mr. William Simpson long ago pointed out, bears obvious traces of being at
      once a tomb and a sacred altar-stone. Sir Richard Burton&rsquo;s original
      sketch of this mystic object shows it as a square and undecorated
      temple-tomb, covered throughout with a tasselled black pall&mdash;a most
      funereal object&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;sacred carpet.&rdquo; It is, in
      point of fact, a simple catafalque. As the Kaaba was adopted direct by
      Mohammad from the early Semitic heathenism of Arabia, and as it must
      always have been treated with the same respect, I do not think we can
      avoid the obvious conclusion that this very ancient tomb has been
      funereally draped in the self-same manner, like those of Biskra, Algiers,
      and Kerouan, from the time of its first erection. <span class="pagenum">417</span><a
      name="link417" id="link417"></a>This case thus throws light on the draping
      of the <i>ashera</i>, as do also the many-coloured draperies and hangings
      of saints&rsquo; catafalques in Algeria and Tunis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor can I resist a passing mention of the Moharram festival, which is said
      to be the commemoration of the death of Hoseyn, the son of Ali (whose holy
      head is preserved at Cairo). This is a rude piece of acting, in which the
      events supposed to be connected with the death of Hoseyn are graphically
      represented; and it ends with a sacred Adonis-like or Osiris-like
      procession, in which the body of the saint is carried and mourned over.
      The funeral is the grand part of the performance; catafalques are
      constructed for the holy corpse, covered with green and gold tinsel&mdash;the
      green being obviously a last reminiscence of the god of vegetation. In
      Bombay, after the dead body and shrine have been carried through the
      streets amid weeping and wailing, they are finally thrown into the sea,
      like King Carnival. I think we need hardly doubt that here we have an
      evanescent relic of the rites of the corn-god, ending in a rain-charm, and
      very closely resembling those of Adonis and Osiris.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if in Islam the great objects of worship are the Kaaba tomb at Mecca
      and the Tomb of the Prophet at Medina, so the most holy spot in the world
      for Christendom is&mdash;the Holy Sepulchre. It was for possession of that
      most sacred place of pilgrimage that Christians fought Moslems through the
      middle ages; and it is there that while faith in the human Christ was
      strong and vigorous the vast majority of the most meritorious pilgrimages
      continued to be directed. To worship at the tomb of the risen Redeemer was
      the highest hope of the devout mediæval Christian. Imitations of the Holy
      Sepulchre occur in abundance all over Europe: one exists at S. Stefano in
      Bologna; another, due to the genius of Alberti, is well known in the
      Ruccellai chapel at Florence. I need hardly recall the Sacro Monte at
      Varallo.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part, however, in Christendom, and especially <span
      class="pagenum">418</span><a name="link418" id="link418"></a>in those
      parts of Christendom remote from Palestine, men contented themselves with
      nearer and more domestic saints. From a very early date we see in the
      catacombs the growth of this practice of offering up prayer by (or to) the
      bodies of the Dead who slept in Christ. A chapel or <i>capella</i>, as
      Dean Burgon has pointed out, meant originally an arched sepulchre in the
      walls of the catacombs, at which prayer was afterwards habitually made:
      and above-ground chapels were modelled, later on, upon the pattern of
      these ancient underground shrines. I have alluded briefly in my second
      chapter to the probable origin of the cruciform church from two galleries
      of the catacombs crossing one another at right angles; the High Altar
      stands there over the body or relics of a Dead Saint; and the chapels
      represent other minor tombs grouped like niches in the catacombs around
      it. A chapel is thus, as Mr. Herbert Spencer phrases it, &ldquo;a tomb
      within a tomb&rdquo;; and a great cathedral is a serried set of such
      cumulative tombs, one built beside the other. Sometimes the chapels are
      actual graves, sometimes they are cenotaphs; but the connexion with death
      is always equally evident. On this subject, I would refer the reader again
      to Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as Christianity was proscribed at Rome and throughout the empire,
      the worship of the dead must have gone on only silently, and must have
      centred in the catacombs or by the graves of saints and martyrs&mdash;the
      last-named being practically mere Christian successors of the willing
      victims of earlier religions. &ldquo;To be counted worthy to suffer&rdquo;
      was the heart&rsquo;s desire of every earnest Christian&mdash;as it still
      is among fresh and living sects like the Salvation Army; and the creed of
      self-sacrifice, whose very name betrays its human-victim origin, was all
      but universal. When Christianity had triumphed, however, and gained not
      only official recognition but official honour, the cult of the martyrs and
      the other faithful dead became with Christian Rome a perfect passion. The
      Holy Innocents, <span class="pagenum">419</span><a name="link419"
      id="link419"></a>St. Stephen Protomartyr, the nameless martyrs of the Ten
      Persecutions, together with Poly carp, Vivia Perpétua, Félicitas, Ignatius
      and all the rest, came to receive from the church a form of veneration
      which only the nice distinctions of the theological mind could enable us
      to discriminate from actual worship. The great procession of the slain for
      Christ in the mosaics of Sant&rsquo; Apollinare Nuovo at Ravenna gives a
      good comprehensive list of the more important of these earliest saints (at
      least for Aryan worshippers) headed by St. Martin, St. Clement, St.
      Justin, St. Lawrence, and St. Hippolytus. Later on came the more mythical
      and poetic figures, derived apparently from heathen gods&mdash;St.
      Catharine, St. Barbara, St. George, St. Christopher. These form as they go
      a perfect new pantheon, circling round the figures of Christ himself, and
      his mother the Madonna, who grows quickly in turn, by absorption of Isis,
      Astarte, and Artemis, into the Queen of Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love-feasts or <i>agapo</i> of the early Christians were usually held,
      in the catacombs or elsewhere, above the bodies of the martyrs.
      Subsequently, the remains of the sainted dead were transferred to lordly
      churches without, like Sant&rsquo; Agnese and San Paolo, where they were
      deposited under the altar or sacred stone thus consecrated, from whose top
      the body and blood of Christ was distributed in the Eucharist. As early as
      the fourth century, we know that no church was complete without some such
      relic; and the passion for martyrs spread so greatly from that period
      onward that at one time no less than 2300 corpses of holy men together
      were buried at S. Prassede. It is only in Rome itself that the full
      importance of this martyr-worship can now be sufficiently understood, or
      the large part which it played in the development of Christianity
      adequately recognised. Perhaps the easiest way for the Protestant reader
      to put himself in touch with this side of the subject is to peruse the
      very interesting and graphic <span class="pagenum">420</span><a
      name="link420" id="link420"></a>account given in the second volume of Mrs.
      Jameson&rsquo;s <i>Sacred and Legendary Art</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have room for a few illustrative examples only.
    </p>
    <p>
      When St. Ambrose founded his new church at Milan, he wished to consecrate
      it with some holy relics. In a vision, he beheld two young men in shining
      clothes, and it was revealed to him that these were holy martyrs whose
      bodies lay near the spot where he lived in the city. He dug for them,
      accordingly, and found two bodies, which proved to be those of two saints,
      Gervasius and Protasius, who had suffered for the faith in the reign of
      Nero. They were installed in the new basilica Ambrose had built at Milan.
      Churches in their honour now exist all over Christendom, the best known
      being those at Venice and Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body of St. Agnes, saint and martyr, who is always represented with
      that familiar emblem, the lamb which she duplicates, lies in a sarcophagus
      under the High Altar of Sant&rsquo; Agnese beyond the Porta Pia, where a
      basilica was erected over the remains by Constantine the Great, only a few
      years after the martyrdom of the saint. The body of St. Cecilia lies
      similarly in the church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. In this last-named
      case, the original house where Cecilia was put to death is said to have
      been consecrated as a place of worship, after the very early savage
      fashion, the room where she suffered possessing especial sanctity. Pope
      Symmachus held a council there in the year 500. This earliest church
      having fallen into ruins during the troubles of the barbarians, Pope
      Paschal I., the great patron of relic-hunting, built a new one in honour
      of the saint in the ninth century. While engaged in the work, he had a
      dream (of a common pattern), when Cecilia appeared to him and showed him
      the place in which she lay buried. Search was made, and the body was found
      in the catacombs of St. Calixtus, wrapped in a shroud of gold tissue,
      while at her feet lay a linen cloth dipped in the sacred blood of her
      martyrdom. Near her were deposited the remains of Valerian, Tiburtius, and
      Maximus, <span class="pagenum">421</span><a name="link421" id="link421"></a>all
      of whom are more or less mixed up in her legend. The body was removed to
      the existing church, the little room where the saint died being preserved
      as a chapel. In the sixteenth century, the sacred building was again
      repaired and restored in the atrocious taste of the time; and the
      sarcophagus was opened before the eyes of several prelates, including
      Cardinal Baronius. The body was found entire, and was then replaced in the
      silver shrine in which it still reposes. Almost every church in Rome has
      thus its entire body of a patron saint, oftenest a martyr of the early
      persecutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many similar cases, immense importance is attached to the fact that the
      body remains, as the phrase goes, &ldquo;uncorrupted&rdquo;; and I may
      mention in this connexion that in the frequent representations of the
      Raising of Lazarus, which occur as &ldquo;emblems of the resurrection&rdquo;
      in the catacombs, the body of Lazarus is represented as a mummy, often
      enclosed in what seems to be a mummy-case. Indeed, it is most reminiscent
      of the Egyptian Osiris images.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pass on to other and more interesting instances of survival in
      corpse-worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great central temple of the Catholic Church is St. Peter&rsquo;s at
      Rome. The very body of the crucified saint lies enshrined under the high
      altar, in a sarcophagus brought from the catacomb near S. Sebastiano. Upon
      this Rock, St. Peter&rsquo;s and the Catholic Church are founded.
      Ana-cletus, the successor of Clement, built a monument over the bones of
      the blessed Peter; and if Peter be a historical person at all, I see no
      reason to doubt that his veritable body actually lies there. St. Paul
      shares with him in the same shrine; but only half the two corpses now
      repose within the stately Confessio in the Sacristy of the papal basilica:
      the other portion of St. Peter consecrates the Lateran; the other portion
      of St. Paul gives sanctity to San Paolo fuori le Mura.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other much venerated bodies at Rome are those of the Quattro Coronati, in
      the church of that name; S. Praxedis <span class="pagenum">422</span><a
      name="link422" id="link422"></a>and St. Pudentiana in their respective
      churches; St. Cosmo and St. Damian; and many more too numerous to mention.
      Several of the Roman churches, like San Clemente, stand upon the site of
      the house of the saint to whom they are dedicated, or whose body they
      preserve, thus recalling the early New Guinea practice. Others occupy the
      site of his alleged martyrdom, or enclose the pillar to which he was
      fastened. The legends of all these Roman saints are full of significant
      echoes of paganism. The visitor to Rome who goes the round of the churches
      and catacombs with an unprejudiced mind must be astonished to find how
      sites, myths, and ceremonies recall at every step familiar heathen holy
      places or stories. In the single church of San Zaccaria at Venice, again,
      I found the bodies of St. Zacharias (father of John the Baptist), St.
      Sabina, St. Tarasius, Sts. Nereus and Achilles, and many other saints too
      numerous to mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      How great importance was attached to the possession of the actual corpse
      or mummy of a saint we see exceptionally well indeed in this case of
      Venice. The bringing of the corpse or mummy of St. Mark from Alexandria to
      the lagoons was long considered the most important event in the history of
      the Republic; the church in which it was housed is the noblest in
      Christendom, and contains an endless series of records of the connexion of
      St. Mark with the city and people that so royally received him. The soul,
      as one may see in Tintoret&rsquo;s famous picture, flitted over sea with
      the body to Venice, warned the sailors of danger by the way, and ever
      after protected the hospitable Republic in all its enterprises. One must
      have lived long in the city of the Lagoons and drunk in its very spirit in
      order to know how absolutely it identified itself with the Evangelist its
      patron. &ldquo;Pax tibi, Marce, evangelista metis,&rdquo; is the motto on
      its buildings. The lion of St. Mark stood high in the Piazzetta to be seen
      of all; he recurs in every detail of sculpture or painting in the Doges&rsquo;
      Palace and the public edifices of the city. The body that lay <span
      class="pagenum">423</span><a name="link423" id="link423"></a>under the
      pall of gold in the great church of the Piazza was a veritable Palladium,
      a very present help in time of trouble. It was no mere sentiment or fancy
      to the Venetians; they knew that they possessed in their own soil, and
      under their own church domes, the body and soul of the second of the
      evangelists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was that the only important helper that Venice could boast. She
      contained also the body of St. George at San Giorgio Maggiore, and the
      body of St. Nicholas at San Niccolo di Lido. The beautiful legend of the
      Doge and the Fisherman (immortalised for us by the pencil of Paris Bordone
      in one of the noblest pictures the world has ever seen) tells us how the
      three great guardian saints, St. Mark, St. George, and St. Nicholas, took
      a gondola one day from their respective churches, and rowed out to sea
      amid a raging storm to circumvent the demons who were coming in a tempest
      to overwhelm Venice. A fourth saint, of far later date, whom the Venetians
      also carried off by guile, was St. Roch of Montpelier. This holy man was a
      very great sanitary precaution against the plague, to which the city was
      much exposed through its eastern commerce. So the men of Venice simply
      stole the body by fraud from Montpelier, and built in its honour the
      exquisite church and Scuola di San Rocco, the great museum of the art of
      Tintoret. The fact that mere possession of the holy body counts in itself
      for much could not be better shown than by these forcible abductions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corpse of St. Nicholas, who was a highly revered bishop of Myra in
      Lycia, lies, as I said, under the high altar of San Niccolo di Lido at
      Venice. But another and more authentic body of the same great saint, the
      patron of sailors and likewise of schoolboys, lies also under the high
      altar of the magnificent basilica of San Nicola at Bari, from which
      circumstance the holy bishop is generally known as St. Nicolas of Bari. A
      miraculous fluid, the Manna di Bari, highly prized by the pious, exudes
      from the remains. A gorgeous cathedral rises over the sepulchre. <span
      class="pagenum">424</span><a name="link424" id="link424"></a>Such emulous
      duplication of bodies and relics is extremely common, both in Christendom
      and in Islam.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made a point of visiting the shrines of a vast number of leading
      saints in various parts of Italy; and could devote a volume to their
      points of interest. The corpse of St. Augustine, for example, lies at
      Pavia in a glorious ark, one of the most sumptuous monuments ever erected
      by the skill of man, as well as one of the loveliest. Padua similarly
      boasts the body of St. Antony of Padua, locally known as &ldquo;il Santo,&rdquo;
      and far more important in his own town than all the rest of the Christian
      pantheon put together. The many-domed church erected over his remains is
      considerably larger than St. Mark&rsquo;s at Venice; and the actual body
      of the saint itself is enclosed in an exquisite marble chapel, designed by
      Sansovino, and enriched with all the noblest art of the Renaissance.
      Dominican monks and nuns make pilgrimages to Bologna, in order to venerate
      the body of St. Dominic, who died in that city, and whose corpse is
      enclosed in a magnificent sarcophagus in the church dedicated to him, and
      adorned with exquisite sculpture by various hands from the time of Niccolo
      Pisano to that of Michael Angelo. Siena has for its special glory St.
      Catherine the second&mdash;the first was the mythical princess of
      Alexandria; and the house of that ecstatic nun is still preserved intact
      as an oratory for the prayers of the pious. Her head, laid by in a silver
      shrine or casket, decorates the altar of her chapel in San Domenico, where
      the famous frescoes of Sodoma too often usurp the entire attention of
      northern visitors. Compare the holy head of Hoseyn at Cairo. The great
      Franciscan church at Assisi, once more, enshrines the remains of the
      founder of the Franciscans, which formerly reposed under the high altar;
      the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli below it encloses the little hut
      which was the first narrow home of the nascent order. I could go on
      multiplying such instances without number; I hope these few will suffice
      to make the Protestant reader feel how real is the reverence <span
      class="pagenum">425</span><a name="link425" id="link425"></a>still paid to
      the very corpses and houses of the saints in Italy. If ever he was present
      at Milan on the festa of San Carlo Borromeo, and saw the peasants from
      neighbouring villages flock in hundreds to kiss the relics of the holy
      man, as I have seen them, he would not hesitate to connect much current
      Christianity with the most primitive forms of corpse-worship and
      mummy-worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      North of the Alps, again, I cannot refrain from mentioning a few salient
      instances, which help to enforce principles already enunciated. At Paris,
      the two great local saints are St. Denis and Ste. Geneviève. St. Denis was
      the first bishop of Lutetia and of the Parish: he is said to have been
      beheaded with his two companions at Montmartre,&mdash;Mons Martyrum. He
      afterwards walked with his head in his hands from that point (now covered
      by the little church of St. Pierre, next door to the new basilica of the
      Sacre Cour), to the spot where he piously desired to be buried. A holy
      woman named Catulla (note that last echo) performed the final rites for
      him at the place where the stately abbey-church of St. Denis now preserves
      his memory. The first cathedral on the spot was erected before the
      Frankish invasion; the second, built by Dagobert, was consecrated (as a
      vision showed) by Christ himself, who descended for the purpose from
      heaven, surrounded by apostles, angels, and St. Denis. The actual head or
      skull of the saint was long preserved in the basilica in a splendid
      reliquary of solid silver, the gift of Marguérite de France, just as
      Hoseyn&rsquo;s head is still preserved at Cairo, and as so many other
      miraculous or oracular heads are kept by savages or barbarians elsewhere.
      Indeed, the anthropological enquirer may be inclined to suppose that the
      severance of thé head from the body and its preservation above ground,
      after the common fashion, gave rise later to the peculiar but by no means
      unique legend. Compare the bear&rsquo;s head in the Aino superstition, as
      well as the oracular German and Scandinavian Nithstangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for <span class="pagenum">426</span><a name="link426" id="link426"></a>Ste.
      Geneviève, she rested first in the church dedicated to her on the site now
      occupied by the Pantheon, which still in part, though secularised,
      preserves her memory. Her body (or what remains of it) lies at present in
      the neighbouring church of St. Etienne du Mont, where every lover of Paris
      surely pays his devotion to the shrine in the most picturesque and
      original building which the city holds, whenever he passes through the
      domain of Ste. Geneviève. How real the devotion of the people still is may
      be seen on any morning of the working week, and still more during the
      octave of the saint&rsquo;s fete-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in many other cases, however, the remains of the virgin patroness of
      Paris have been more than once removed from place to place for safe
      custody. The body was originally buried in the crypt of the old abbey
      church of the Holy Apostles on the Ile de la Cité. When the Normans
      overran the country, the monks carried it away with them in a wooden box
      to a place of safety. As soon as peace was once more restored, the corpse
      was enshrined in a splendid <i>châsse</i>; while the empty tomb was still
      treated with the utmost reverence. At the Revolution, the actual bones, it
      is said, were destroyed; but the sarcophagus or cenotaph survived the
      storm, and was transferred to St. Etienne. Throughout the Neuvaine,
      thousands of the faithful still flock to worship it. The sarcophagus is
      believed even now to contain some holy portions of the saint&rsquo;s body,
      saved from the wreck by pious adherents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other familiar examples will occur to every one, such as the bones of the
      Magi or Three Kings, preserved in a reliquary in the Cathedral at Cologne;
      those of St. Ursula and the 11,000 virgins; those of St. Stephen and St.
      Lawrence at Rome; those of St. Hubert, disinterred and found uncorrupted,
      at the town of the same name in the Ardennes; and those of St. Longinus in
      his chapel at Mantua. All these relics and bodies perform astounding
      miracles, and <span class="pagenum">427</span><a name="link427"
      id="link427"></a>all have been the centres of important cults for a
      considerable period.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Britain, from the first stages of Christianity, the reverence paid to
      the bodies of saints was most marked, and the story of their wanderings
      forms an important part of our early annals. Indeed, I dwell so long upon
      this point because few northerners of the present day can fully appreciate
      the large part which the Dead Body plays and has played for many centuries
      in Christian worship. Only those who, like me, have lived long in
      thoroughly Catholic countries, have made pilgrimages to numerous famous
      shrines, and have waded through reams of Anglo-Saxon and other early
      mediaeval documents, can really understand this phase of Christian
      hagiology. To such people it is abundantly clear that the actual Dead Body
      of some sainted man or woman has been in many places the chief object of
      reverence for millions of Christians in successive generations. A good
      British instance is found in the case of St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s corpse. The
      tale of its wanderings is too long to be given here in full; it should be
      read in any good history of Durham. I epitomize briefly. The body of the
      devoted missionary of the north was first kept for some time at
      Lindisfarne. When, at the end of eleven years, the saint&rsquo;s tomb was
      opened, his outer form was found still incorrupt; and so for more than 800
      years it was believed to remain. It rested at Lindisfarne till 875, when
      the piratical Danes invaded Northumbria. The monks, regarding St. Cuthbert
      as their greatest treasure, fled inland, carrying the holy body with them
      on their own shoulders. Such translations of sacred corpses are common in
      Christian and heathen history. After many wanderings, during which it was
      treated with the utmost care and devotion, the hallowed body found an
      asylum for a while at Chester-le-Street in 883. In 995, it was transferred
      to Ripon, where it sanctified the minster by even so short a sojourn; but
      in the same year it went forth again, on its way north to Lindisfarne. On
      the way, however, it miraculously <span class="pagenum">428</span><a
      name="link428" id="link428"></a>signified (by stubborn refusal to move)
      its desire to rest for ever at Durham&mdash;a town whose strong natural
      position and capacity for defence does honour to the saint&rsquo;s
      military judgment. Here, enclosed in a costly shrine, it remained working
      daily miracles till the Reformation. The later grave was opened in 1826,
      when the coffin was found to enclose another, made in 1104: and this again
      contained a third, which answered the description of the sarcophagus made
      in 698, when the saint was raised from his first grave. The innermost case
      contained, not indeed the uncorrupted body of Cuthbert, but a skeleton,
      still entire, and wrapped in fine robes of embroidered silk. No story
      known to me casts more light on corpse-worship than does this one when
      read with all the graphic details of the original authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      But everywhere in Britain we get similar local saints, whose bodies or
      bones performed marvellous miracles and were zealously guarded against
      sacrilegious intruders. Bede himself is already full of such holy corpses:
      and in later days they increased by the hundred. St. Alban at St. Alban&rsquo;s,
      the protomartyr of Britain; the &ldquo;white hand&rdquo; of St. Oswald,
      that when all else perished remained white and uncorrupted because blessed
      by Aidan; St. Etheldreda at Ely, another remarkable and illustrative
      instance; Edward the Confessor at Westminster Abbey; these are but a few
      out of hundreds of examples which will at once occur to students of our
      history. And I will add that sometimes the legends of these saints link us
      on unexpectedly to far earlier types of heathen worship; as when we read
      concerning St. Edmund of East Anglia, the patron of Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s,
      that Ingvar the viking took him by force, bound him to a tree, scourged
      him cruelly, made him a target for the arrows of the pagan Danes, and
      finally beheaded him. Either, I say, a god-making sacrifice of the
      northern heathens; or, failing that, a reminiscence, like St. Sebastian,
      of such god-making rites as preserved <span class="pagenum">429</span><a
      name="link429" id="link429"></a>in the legends of ancient martyrs. Compare
      here, once more, the Aino bear-sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during the later middle ages, the sacred Body of Britain, above all
      others, was undoubtedly that of Thomas A&rsquo;Becket at Canterbury.
      Hither, as we know, all England went on pilgrimage; and nothing could more
      fully show the rapidity of canonisation in such cases than the fact that
      even the mighty Henry II. had to prostrate himself before his old enemy&rsquo;s
      body and submit to a public scourging at the shrine of the new-made
      martyr. For several hundred years after his death there can be no doubt at
      all that the cult of St. Thomas of Canterbury was much the most real and
      living worship throughout the whole of England; its only serious rivals in
      popular favour being the cult of St. Cuthbert to the north of Humber, and
      that of St. Etheldreda in the Eastern Counties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holy heads in particular were common in Britain before the Reformation. A
      familiar Scottish case is that of the head of St. Fergus, the apostle of
      Banff and the Pictish Highlands, transferred to and preserved at the royal
      seat of Scone. &ldquo;By Sanct Fergus heid at Scone&rdquo; was the
      favourite oath of the Scotch monarchs, as &ldquo;Par Sainct Denys&rdquo;
      was that of their French contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In almost all these cases, again, and down to the present day, popular
      appreciation goes long before official Roman canonisation. Miracles are
      first performed at the tomb, and prayers are answered; an irregular cult
      precedes the formal one. Even in our own day, only a few weeks after
      Cardinal Manning&rsquo;s death, advertisements appeared in Catholic papers
      in London, giving thanks for spiritual and temporal blessings received
      through the intervention of Our Lady, the saints, &ldquo;and our beloved
      Cardinal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This popular canonisation has often far outrun the regular official
      acceptance, as in the case of Joan of Arc in France at the present day, or
      of &ldquo;Maister John Schorn, that blessed man born,&rdquo; in the Kent
      of the middle ages. Thus countries like Wales and Cornwall are full of
      local and <span class="pagenum">430</span><a name="link430" id="link430"></a>patriotic
      saints, often of doubtful Catholicity, like St. Cadoc, St. Padern, St.
      Petrock, St. Piran, St. Ruan, and St. Illtyd, not to mention more accepted
      cases, like St. Asaph and St. David. The fact is, men have everywhere felt
      the natural desire for a near, a familiar, a recent, and a present god or
      saint; they have worshipped rather the dead whom they loved and revered
      themselves than the elder gods and the remoter martyrs who have no body
      among them, no personal shrine, no local associations, no living memories.
      &ldquo;I have seen in Brittany,&rdquo; says a French correspondent of Mr.
      Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s, &ldquo;the tomb of a pious and charitable priest
      covered with garlands: people flocked to it by hundreds to pray of him
      that he would procure them restoration to health, and guard over their
      children.&rdquo; There, with the Christian addition of the supreme God, we
      get once more the root-idea of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should like to add that beyond such actual veneration of the bodies of
      saints and martyrs, there has always existed a definite theory in the
      Roman church that no altar can exist without a relic. The altar, being
      itself a monumental stone, needs a body or part of a body to justify and
      consecrate it. Dr. Rock, a high authority, says in his <i>Hierurgia</i>,
      &ldquo;By the regulations of the Church it is ordained that the Holy
      Sacrifice of the Mass be offered upon an altar which contains a stone
      consecrated by a Bishop, enclosing the relics of some saint or martyr; and
      be covered with three linen cloths that have been blessed for that purpose
      with an appropriate form of benediction.&rdquo; The consecration of the
      altar, indeed, is considered even more serious than the consecration of
      the church itself; for without the stone and its relic, the ceremony of
      the Mass cannot be performed at all. Even when Mass has to be said in a
      private house, the priest brings a consecrated stone and its relic along
      with him; and other such stones were carried in the <i>retables</i> or
      portable altars so common in military expeditions of the middle ages. The
      church is thus <span class="pagenum">431</span><a name="link431"
      id="link431"></a>a tomb, with chapel tombs around it; it contains a stone
      monument covering a dead body or part of a body; and in it is made and
      exhibited the Body of Christ, in the form of the consecrated and
      transmuted wafer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only, however, is the altar in this manner a reduced or symbolical
      tomb, and not only is it often placed above the body of a saint, as at St.
      Mark&rsquo;s and St. Peter&rsquo;s, but it also sometimes consists itself
      of a stone sarcophagus. One such sarcophagus exists in the Cathedral at
      St. Malo; I have seen other coffin-shaped altars in the monastery of La
      Trappe near Algiers and elsewhere. When, however, the altar stands, like
      that at St. Peter&rsquo;s, above the actual body of a saint, it does not
      require to contain a relic; otherwise it does. That is to say, it must be
      either a real or else an attenuated and symbolical sarcophagus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eastern church, a sort of relic-bag, called an Antimins, is
      necessary for the proper performance of the Holy Eucharist. It consists of
      a square cloth, laid on the altar or wrapped up in its coverings, and
      figured with a picture representing the burial of Christ by Joseph of
      Arimathea and the Holy Women. This brings it very near to the Adonis and
      Hoseyn ceremonies. But it must necessarily contain some saintly relic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from corpse-worship and relic-worship in the case of saints,
      Catholic Christendom has long possessed an annual Commemoration of the
      Dead, the <i>Jour des Morts</i>, which links itself on directly to earlier
      ancestor-worship. It is true, this commemoration is stated officially, and
      no doubt correctly, to owe its origin (in its recognised form) to a
      particular historical person, Adam de Saint Victor: but when we consider
      how universal such commemorations and annual dead-feasts have been in all
      times and places, we can hardly doubt that the church did but adopt and
      sanctify a practice which, though perhaps accounted heathenish, had never
      died out at all among the mass of believers. The very desire to be buried
      in a church or churchyard, and all that it implies, link on Christian
      usage here <span class="pagenum">432</span><a name="link432" id="link432"></a>once
      more to primitive corpse-worship. Compare with the dead who sleep with
      Osiris. In the middle ages, many people were buried in chapels containing
      the body (or a relic) of their patron saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>In short, from first to last, religion never gets far away from these
      its earliest and profoundest associations. &ldquo;God and immortality,&rdquo;&mdash;those
      two are its key-notes. And those two are one; for the god in the last
      resort is nothing more than the immortal ghost, etherealised and extended.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, whenever religion travels too far afield from its
      emotional and primal base in the cult of the nearer dead, it must either
      be constantly renewed by fresh and familiar objects of worship, or it
      tends to dissipate itself into mere vague pantheism. A new god, a new
      saint, a &ldquo;revival of religion,&rdquo; is continually necessary. <i>The
      Sacrifice of the Mass is wisely repeated at frequent intervals; but that
      alone does not suffice; men want the assurance of a nearer, a more
      familiar deity.</i> In our own time, and especially in Protestant and
      sceptical England and America, this need has made itself felt in the rise
      of spiritualism and kindred beliefs, which are but the doctrine of the
      ghost or shade in its purified form, apart, as a rule, from the higher
      conception of a supreme ruler. ~And what is Positivism itself save the
      veneration of the mighty dead, just tinged with vague ethical yearnings
      after the abstract service of living humanity? I have known many men of
      intellect, suffering under a severe bereavement&mdash;the loss of a wife
      or a dearly-loved child&mdash;take refuge for a time either in
      spiritualism or Catholicism. The former seems to give them the practical
      assurance of actual bodily intercourse with the dead, through mediums or
      table-turning; the latter supplies them with a theory of death which makes
      reunion a probable future for them. This desire for direct converse with
      the dead we saw exemplified in a very early or primitive stage in the case
      of the Mandan wives who talk lovingly to their husbands&rsquo; skulls; it
      probably forms the basis for the common habit of keeping the head <span
      class="pagenum">433</span><a name="link433" id="link433"></a>while burying
      the body, whose widespread results we have so frequently noticed. I have
      known two instances of modern spiritualists who similarly had their wives&rsquo;
      bodies embalmed, in order that the spirit might return and inhabit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Thus the Cult of the Dead, which is the earliest origin of all
      religion, in the sense of worship, is also the last relic of the religious
      spirit which survives the gradual decay of faith due to modern scepticism.
      To this cause I refer on the whole the spiritualistic utterances of so
      many among our leaders of modern science. They have rejected religion, but
      they cannot reject the inherited and ingrained religious emotions.</i>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.&mdash;CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ND <span
      class="pagenum">434</span><a name="link434" id="link434"></a>now we have
      reached at last the end of our long and toilsome disquisition. I need
      hardly say, to those who have persisted with me so far, that I do not
      regard a single part of it all as by any means final. There is not a
      chapter in this book, indeed, which I could not have expanded to double or
      treble its present length, had I chosen to include in it a tithe of the
      evidence I have gathered on the subject with which it deals. But for many
      adequate reasons, compression was imperative. Some of the greatest
      treatises ever written on this profoundly important and interesting
      question have met with far less than the attention they deserved because
      they were so bulky and so overloaded with evidence that the reader could
      hardly see the wood for the trees; he lost the thread of the argument in
      the mazes of example. In my own case, I had or believed I had a central
      idea; and I desired to set that idea forth with such simple brevity as
      would enable the reader to grasp it and to follow it. I go, as it were,
      before a Grand Jury only. I do not pretend in any one instance to have
      proved my points; I am satisfied if I have made out a <i>prima facie</i>
      case for further enquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      My object in the present reconstructive treatise has therefore been merely
      to set forth in as short a form as was consistent with clearness my
      conception of the steps by which mankind arrived at its idea of its God. I
      have not tried to produce evidence on each step in full; I have only tried
      to lay before the general public a rough sketch of a psychological <span
      class="pagenum">435</span><a name="link435" id="link435"></a>rebuilding,
      and to suggest at the same time to scholars and anthropologists some
      inkling of the lines along which evidence in favour of my proposed
      reconstruction is likeliest to be found. This book is thus no more than a
      summary of probabilities. Should it succeed in attracting attention and
      arousing interest in so vast and fundamental a subject, I shall hope to
      follow it up by others in future, in which the various component elements
      of my theory will be treated in detail, and original authorities will be
      copiously quoted with the fullest references. As, however, in this
      preliminary outline of my views I have dealt with few save well-known
      facts, and relied for the most part upon familiar collocations of
      evidence, I have not thought it necessary to encumber my pages with
      frequent and pedantic footnotes, referring to the passages or persons
      quoted. The scholar will know well enough where to look for the proofs he
      needs, while the general reader can only judge my rough foreshadowing of a
      hypothesis according as he is impressed by its verisimilitude or the
      contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, on the other hand, this <i>avant-courier</i> of a reasoned system
      fails to interest the public, I must perforce be content to refrain from
      going any deeper in print into this fascinating theme, on which I have
      still an immense number of ideas and facts which I desire the opportunity
      of publicly ventilating.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish also to remark before I close that I do not hold dogmatically to
      the whole or any part of the elaborate doctrine here tentatively
      suggested. I have changed my own mind far too often, with regard to these
      matters, in the course of my personal evolution, ever to think I have
      reached complete finality. Fifteen or twenty years ago, indeed, I was rash
      enough to think I had come to anchor, when I first read Mr. Herbert
      Spencer&rsquo;s sketch of the origin of religion in the opening volume of
      the <i>Principles of Sociology</i>. Ten or twelve years since, doubts and
      difficulties again obtruded themselves. Six years ago, once more, <span
      class="pagenum">436</span><a name="link436" id="link436"></a>when <i>The
      Golden Bough</i> appeared, after this book had been planned and in part
      executed, I was forced to go back entirely upon many cherished former
      opinions, and to reconsider many questions which I had fondly imagined
      were long since closed for me. Since that time, new lights have been
      constantly shed upon me from without, or have occurred to me from within:
      and I humbly put this sketch forward now for what it may be worth, not
      with the idea that I have by any means fathomed the whole vast truth, but
      in the faint hope that I may perhaps have looked down here and there a
      little deeper into the profound abysses beneath us than has been the lot
      of most previous investigators. At the same time, I need hardly reiterate
      my sense of the immense obligations under which I lie to not a few among
      them, and preeminently to Mr. Spencer, Mr. Frazer, Mr. Hartland, and Dr.
      Tylor. My only claim is that I may perhaps have set forth a scheme of
      reconstruction which further evidence will possibly show to be true in
      parts, and mistaken in others..
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, by strictly confining my attention to religious
      features, properly so called, to the exclusion of mythology, ethics, and
      all other external accretions or accidents, I trust I have been able to
      demonstrate more clearly than has hitherto been done the intimate
      connexion which always exists between cults in general and the worship of
      the Dead God, natural or artificial. Even if I have not quite succeeded in
      inducing the believer in primitive animism to reconsider his prime dogma
      of the origin of gods from all-pervading spirits (of which affiliation I
      can see no proof in the evidence before us), I venture to think I shall at
      any rate have made him feel that Ancestor-Worship and the Cult of the Dead
      God have played a far larger and deeper part than he has hitherto been
      willing to admit in the genesis of the religious emotions. Though I may
      not have raised the worship of the Dead Man to a supreme and unique place
      in the god-making process, I have at least, I trust, raised it to a
      position of higher importance than <span class="pagenum">437</span><a
      name="link437" id="link437"></a>it has hitherto held, even since the
      publication of Mr. Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s epoch-making researches. I
      believe I have made it tolerably clear that the vast mass of existing gods
      or divine persons, when we come to analyse them, do actually turn out to
      be dead and deified human beings. In short, it is my hope that I have
      rehabilitated Euhemerism.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the place, at the very end of so long a disquisition, to
      examine the theory of primitive animism. I would therefore only say
      briefly here that I do not deny the actual existence of that profoundly
      animistic frame of mind which Mr. Im Thurn has so well depicted among the
      Indians of Guiana; nor that which exists among the Sa-moyeds of Siberia;
      nor that which meets us at every turn in historical accounts of the old
      Roman religion. I am quite ready to admit that, to people at that stage of
      religious evolution, the world seems simply thronged with spirits on every
      side, each of whom has often his own special functions and peculiar
      prerogatives. But I fail to see that any one of these ideas is
      demonstrably primitive. Most often, we can trace ghosts, spirits, and gods
      to particular human origins: where spirits exist in abundance and pervade
      all nature, I still fail to understand why they may not be referred to the
      one known source and spring of all ghostly beings. It is abundantly clear
      that no distinction of name or rite habitually demarcates these ubiquitous
      and uncertain spirits at large from those domestic gods whose origin is
      perfectly well remembered in the family circle. I make bold to believe,
      therefore, that in every such case we have to deal with unknown and
      generalised ghosts,&mdash;with ghosts of most varying degrees of
      antiquity. If any one can show me a race of spirit-believers who do not
      worship their own ancestral spirits, or can adduce any effective prime
      differentia between the spirit that was once a living man, and the spirit
      that never was human at all, I will gladly hear him. Up to date, however,
      no such race has been pointed out, and no such differentia ever posited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum">438</span><a name="link438" id="link438"></a>truth
      is, we have now no primitive men at all. Existing men are the descendants
      of people who have had religions, in all probability, for over a million
      years. The best we can do, therefore, is to trace what gods we can to
      their original source, and believe that the rest are of similar
      development. And whither do we track them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I have been able to trace back the origin of the
      best-known minor provincial deities,&rdquo; says Sir Alfred Lyall,
      speaking of India in general, &ldquo;they are usually men of past
      generations who have earned special promotion and brevet rank among
      disembodied ghosts.... Of the numerous local gods known to have been
      living men, by far the greater proportion derive from the ordinary
      canonisation of holy personages.... The number of shrines thus raised in
      Berar alone to these anchorites and persons deceased in the odour of
      sanctity is large, and it is constantly increasing. Some of them have
      already attained the rank of temples.&rdquo; We have seen that an acute
      observer, Erman, came to a similar conclusion about the gods of those very
      Ostyaks who are often quoted as typical examples of primitive animists. Of
      late years, all the world over, numerous unprejudiced investigators, like
      Mr. Duff Macdonald and Captain Henderson, have similarly come to the
      conclusion that the gods of the natives among whom they worked were all of
      human origin; while we know that some whole great national creeds, like
      the Shinto of Japan, recognise no deities at all save living kings and
      dead ancestral spirits. Under these circumstances, judging the unknown by
      the known, I hesitate to take the very bold step of positing any new and
      fanciful source for the small residuum of unresolved gods whose human
      origin is less certainly known to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one word, <i>I believe that corpse-worship is the protoplasm of
      religion, while admitting that folk-lore is the protoplasm of mythology,
      and of its more modern and philosophical offshoot, theology</i>.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
